LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Anticipation
In domination 
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Full speed or nothing 
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation 
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Lux Æterna

Emancipation 
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike 
Amplification 
Lightning the nation
Never alive more
Than right here tonight

Full speed or nothing

LYRICS

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it’s yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiving misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it’s darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Kirk Hammett

Have you ever opened a bag of chips and thoughts, why is there so much empty space? Did I just pay for mostly air with a side of chips? You are not alone! For years, I've thought I was getting ripped off with each delicious bag of chips. Today, I want to find out if that is true and I am starting with the biggest culprit of them all - Doritos!

Disclaimer: At 11:56, the Breakage Rates for the More Chips Bag and the Average Bag are accidentally swapped; the More Chips Bag Breakage Rate is actually 79.8%, and the Average Bag Breakage Rate is 74.9%.

Theorists, what is McDonald's selling? The answer seems obvious - fast food! Most of us have partaken in their Big Mac burgers, fries, and other staples of the golden arches. Yet, that may be a big ol' LIE! That's right, Ronald McDonald may not be a clown selling some of our favorite indulgent quick serve foods. In fact, McDonald's may be in a completely different business all together. What is that business? You'll have to watch to find out!

I just talk about technology / inventions / gizmo / gadgets / innovations / whatever in this one. I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. 


This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)

This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. 

I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.

Stay safe ❤️ see you next video.

90,x-I4OanmWQg,super powers,"Thanks to Keeps for sponsoring this video! Head to https://keeps.com/icecreamsandwich to learn more and get 50% off your first order of Keeps. 

hi guys new video. this video is about super powers. a while ago i asked you on my community page if you had a super power what would it be
and this is some of the asnwers. there are a lot of good and creative super powers in the comments, and i sadly only covered like 4.
i want to do more of this, im thinking i could cover more of the comments in like a tier list kind of thing? maybe?
i'll let you know.
spiderman has nothing on these super powers. spiderman can jump. cool. try literally flying.
best super power you could ask for. actually there was a shape shifting power that i saw i liked a lot.
and if you shape shift you can just fly by being a bird. kind of op tbh.
well anyway, idk if you can tell i did some special saucy things in this video that will allow me to animate faster.
i will tell you what i did in a later video. i hope you guys like the way it looks. 

thank you for watching as always ❤️

It's a video that is wildly unorganized random thoughts about minecraft. I was kind of random about these minecraft thoughts but that is a okay in my opinion. I don't have a boss! You can't fire me! 
I maybe should have had more structure in here but I think I made some solid enough jokes where it can stand up on its own though :) sold out pretty hard this video though lol going to take a sponsorship break after this for a little while. I feel like you guys earned it.
There's a part in the video where I screen cap the suggested page and trending page and there's like TommyInnit and Jschlatt and JaidenAnimations in there so I guess you can see what the youtube algorithm wants me to watch. Very Pochamp.
Minecraft is the game I have played most and I love it so this video was more or less self indulgent for me. I hope it makes you laugh at least once.
I made a highschool presentation about minecraft and I got a good grade but probably only because the teacher felt sorry for me.
I love the cozy minecraft rain and listening to it inside my house. It is so comfortable.
The Allay is the new minecraft mob that won minecraft live vote! I voted for the Allay because he is more helpful even though the copper golem was really cute.

end of year post. This was a longer video which is all thanks to Matt! You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.

Anyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day. Either as a farmer or a tourist who knows.

I hope you enjoyed this video. More to come.

I thought working in food jobs would be worse but I think I had a worse time in the UPS store. Looking back now I think it was funny. In the moment though it was less of that and more annoying. Crazy customers be crazy. And I imagine people working in retail now have even crazier stories from the past year. My stories are from years ago.

hello how's it going. This cartoon is done and now you are watching it. Isn't that wild? yes. I hope you like this one. It's about the times I played sports. I played basketball, baseball... I am just realizing right now that baseball is called base ball because you run around the bases... wow. I really just didn't know that this whole time. Anyway I also did skiing and track and field. I was bad at everything I did. I also talk about how I'm really bad at golf, but I am kind of thinking listening back to it that you kinda had to be there for that one. I think I've come a long way when it comes to making these videos but oof sometimes I just fall right on my face when it comes to telling stories. But it's all about improvement right? I'll just do better next time :)


I find that I am not really big into competitive stuff. Sports being one thing, but video games too. I like more casual games like minecraft. I used to be big into league of legends, but haven't played in years. It was so toxic, so now I just play block game :) and make block house.


thanks for watching ❤️ hope you liked it.

Yo wassup the video it is done. This video is about the time I had appendicitis and was sent to the hospital where I got emergency surgery. This video actually had a due date (today) for the sponsor so there was a couple things that got left out of the story, they were tiny details but it was things like my friends came to visit me after my surgery and it was really nice! It meant a lot more than I expected it to. My friends were the real stars here and I don't think I did them real justice tbh so maybe another day I'll do a retelling of the story, podcast style or something. I might take a break from sponsors for a video or 2 so I don't run into this problem again. Also I'm getting worried the sponsorship reads are just funnier than the actual video lol.


But yeah the appendicitis thing. It was terrible. Especially getting sick all over the place. I remember that doctor looking at me and being like ""you need to stick this tube in your stomach"" and I was thinking I wasn't ready but didn't really have a choice. There was no room for push back it was all or nothing. It was a little freaky but I think I'm so lucky to have my friends in my life to support me. They were there to bring me to the hospital, support me emotionally, take care of my belongings when I abandoned them in the classroom.


Also I learned a lot about the hospitalization process. It's pretty fast like I was just given a room right away. One moment I was given an assessment and the next I was given a patient robe to put on, I hardly had time to think!


TIME TO GET TO WORK ON THE NEXT VIDEO!

Here's the tier list:
https://tiermaker.com/create/door-854724

I'm an idiot and made the tier list to have an A+ instead of an S and didn't realize until I was almost done with the video but whatever the concept is the same. That website is kinda sketchy too for making a tier list. I wanted to make a tier list and it wanted me to sign up with a twitter account and requested ALL ACCESS to my twitter account. And there's no other website that lets you make tier lists so I just made a different twitter account so that I could make the tier list anyway. And it's only shady for making tier lists you can use tier lists for free without account access.



Also I am so tired cuz I needed to get this video done by literally today and I procrastinated a ton and stayed up really late to make sure it was finished. Idk why I do these things to myself. But it was a fun video so whatever! I always feel like I am worried about telling a story correctly and making sure it makes sense but for this I'm literally just ranking doors. No pressure at all. And that made it more enjoyable to make. I just need to get better about procrastination is all.

I was late for posting this video and didn't finish until after the state fair ended :( but that's okay I wanted to post it anyway. I had a couple thoughts on state fair stuff and I made a video on those things. The state fair food primarily. Thank you to Jaiden to doing a little voice bit in the beginning there. It was literally one word but hey credit where credit is due.

The state fair has good food. I love it so much I was sad I couldn't go this year. There's corn dogs, cheese curds, french fries, cookies, milk and a ton more. There's a lot of other foods that I hate though but it's a big part of why people go in the first place. To each their own.

This video took longer to make because I was programming new tools to make the animation process easier. It was... kind of a weird thing to do. I hope it made the process faster but I didn't measure it so ..oops!

I'm going to try to post a couple more times before the year ends. It's been too sparse this year.

OOOOHHHH 2 VIDEOS IN LESS THAN 28 DAYS????
HOW DID HE DO IT??? ˢˡᵉᵉᵖ ᵈᵉᵖʳᶦᵛᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ

This video was about a food fight I experienced back in jr high school. It was uneventful but eventful at the same time. More chaos than food fight if I'm honest. But you probably already know that because who reads the description before watching the video am I right.

It was a bad time because we got punished in an intense way, but it was also a good time because it was really crazy to be a part of. School isn't always that great so to be able to spice things up with U̴̡̧̕N̵̩̠̓́R̶̰̪̒Ė̶̘̟L̸̙̤̿E̸̜͖͌N̴̦̪̈́T̵͗̔͜Ĩ̷͙͊N̸͍̞̎G̴͉̯̊̑ ̶̣̈́D̷͉͐Ĕ̴̱͋S̸̨̰̿̋T̴̙̲̋R̵̮̩̐̓Ú̸͕̊C̴͇̹̓T̶̙̏̔ͅĬ̷̤Ô̵̡̰͘N̸̞̊ ̶̝̦͆́Â̵̮͚͋N̷͉̓D̷̳͉̏ ̷̡̿C̷̘̿H̵̘̖̐A̶̠̅O̷̧̓S̶͔̽ is a fun way to keep things interesting.

I also partnered with youtooz to create a little icecreamsandwich figurine. I talk about it at the end of the video. If you follow me outside of youtube you probably know that by know. It's exciting actually it turned out great. I hope you like it too!

Oh also I am starting another channel to put my short animations on. Usually I post them to tiktok or instagram or twitter but I think putting them on youtube. It might be the main home for them in the future. I'm still working on setting it up so things might change. 
Check it out here if you're in to that kind of thing: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6KVHFHpCwujbw2TfKnQ3uQ

thanks for watching ❤️ see you next video.

101,6-T-Rsoq5a0,super dream,"I'm not superstitious at all. I really cannot explain this, and I sound like a crazy idiot but whatever. It's a story. It feels kind of cool that it happened though. This was on the SNES super mario world game if you wanna go check out the secret yourself. I will have to double check which castle it was in though. Might have been Lemmy's castle. If there's a snake block just follow it down the hole I promise it'll work.


Also my face is in this one. Kind of a face reveal if you want to put it that way. I was nervous about showing my face in my videos for the longest time but the longer I've had this channel the more I think it's more effort than it's worth. I mean I wasn't gaining anything by being hidden. So enjoy my ugly mug and long no-haircut-in-several-months hair. And my dice.


Sometimes I think about the origin of the universe and then I'm like ""but what came before THAT"" and it's kind of freaky. There's so much mystery in that it kind of makes you think like what else don't we know? Are psychic abilities really possible? Probably not, and even after my premonition dream I don't think any differently about superstitious stuff. But it's fun to think about what if it were real.


Do you guys still read these descriptions? I just kind of use it as a thought dump. bloo blah blee bla bloo blee



Anyway thanks for stopping by again. Love you all. Here's some links for merch and twitter. I hope you have a good day ❤️ you deserve it.

102,i8nqsIIFp2o,getting sick,"This video is about getting sick. It's not as bad as my last hospital video, but it was a frustrating experience. I am over the sickness now, but it was annoying to be sick out of nowhere and wanting to record, so I just made a video about getting sick. I'm very smart.

I have two more videos this year minimum so I hope you enjoy

103,s-MoeONH5Ug,difficulty eating new york pizza,"Thanks to Keeps for sponsoring this video! Head to https://keeps.com/icecreamsandwich to learn more and get 50% off your first order of Keeps. 

i went to new york, and had pizza in new york. the experience was really fun. i saw a lot of stuff and ate a lot of food but the highlight of the journey was the pizza from some random pizza joint. it was a really interesting experience because in the midwest everything is calm and spread out, in new york (and this was the first time ive been in new york) it's all dense and active! i really liked it i wish i could be there more tbh.

i actually had a lot more to say in this video, but i cut it down because i ran out of time and needed to post today for CONTRACT REASONS which is not fun or preferable. I have been working on posting more but somehow always always always run up against some deadline. I am going to implement a new strategy where I am making a little bit of content every day instead of planning a ton and then making a lot of content all at once. idk what's the solution, but hopefully this workflow will be better for me. I just want to very casually make a video and be like ""hey i was in ny had pizza was a good time"" or ""hey i did this thing here's what happened funny jokes bla bla bla"" and not have it be once every one or two months. idk im just venting at this point. just know that i really appreciate you checking out the video even though my posts are super spotty, it's really helpful.

thank you for watching as always ❤️

YOUR COMMENTS
-Some redditors brought up the fact that Aldrich could have been dreaming of Priscilla - not Yorshka. I definitely should have mentioned this as a possibility, though I personally think it's more likely that he's dreaming of Yorshka - who fits the description as a ""young, pale girl in hiding"" and has a relationship to Gwndolin, who Aldrich is dreaming through. 

-Also apparently the Japanese text for divine blessing COMPARES gwynevere to the queen. The english text seems to imply that Gwynevere IS the queen. The more you know. 


MY EXTRA THOUGHTS
-The pontiff blades are described as being eaten away by insects, maybe the same insects that are found in the deep. 

-I could have done a better job making it clear at the start that Gundyr is IMPLIED to have met the firekeeper who never met her champion. It's never explicitly stated.

-The fire linking curse that lothric and lorian are afflicted by could be referring to the fact that people, souls and lands are forced together and ""twisted"" in order for someone to come along and link the fire. I have a lot to say about lothric / lorian in the next video

-The candles in the cathedral of the deep look a bit like the ""lake"" symbols from bloodborne, but maybe i'm reaching a bit..

-Sorry this video was so late. Currently in the stressful process of moving, and life got in the way a bit this month.

►Alex Roe - Demon's Souls - Let Strength Be Granted
►34 Nashandra (Dark Souls 2 OST)


PREPARE TO WHY
I think the story I've built will be a good framework for future theorycrafting, but even after this, you should still have questions. I only went into storylines related to the ending, but there are definitely unexplained parts of the story that I left out because I can't find definitive answers.

1. The opening cutscene. Where are we in the opening cutscene, with this tree and the kingdom reflected in the water? Also, WHEN are we, if she's referring to Drangleic in the past tense?

2. Who are the giants?

3. What did King Vendrick steal?

4. Why does the giant lord give you the giant's kinship? Why do we need the giant's kinship to open the throne?

5. Why does the emerald herald say we're breaking the shackles of fate, when we're clearly adhering to fate by linking the fire all over again? Is she referring to how we're breaking the shackles of the undead curse?
 
7. Why does Nashandra just wait at the throne to be challenged over and over again? Nashandra guided you to the throne, presumably so you can open it for her - but it's not like she is capable of taking the giant's kinship from you once you're defeated. Kinship isn't a physical thing. Does she want you to get inside the throne, or not? I can't help but feel like there's something missing here.

8. The Herald seems to be freed of her purpose..but there's a final twist.

She is the one who brought you to Drangleic.

9. As a final note, do you think linking the flame is done at the far fire when you start New Game Plus, or in the kiln?

Kai Cenat (aka @KaiCenatLive) soon to be the the world’s most subscribed to steamer on Twitch, but up until now he still is in an unfinished room. To take his subathon (aka MAFIAthon) to the next level, I decided to surprise him with his dream steaming setup! This was absolutely insane to make becuase we only had one day to make it happen. To distract Kai for the day, we sent him to Universal Studios with an all access pass and he had a blast. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! Kai loved his new Spiderman gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Thanks to the @Switchbacksfc for hosting us! 

As soon as I heard that iShowSpeed’s birthday was coming up I knew that I had to be a part of it! That’s why I was stoked when Adin Ross reached out and asked if I could build him a custom Cristiano Ronaldo statue to surprise Speed with for his birthday livestream! You see, I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), but I've never built something made of triangles. The Beem Team and I decided to take things over the top for this by making the statue life size and wearing the uniform from the 2022 World Cup. To top things off, we only had 7 days to build it because everything is always last minute. After doing 20 hour days, we got barely got it done in time and had to deliver it accross the country to California. Both iShowSpeed and Adin Ross were AMAZED at how good the statue turned out turned out! This build was a real struggle to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

I have always hated scary movies but have history of going to some of the scariest places in the world such as I Survived the Worlds Scariest Clown Motel and Overnight in the World's Most Haunted Hotel, but this time we are taking things to a whole new level by staying Overnight in the REAL Conjuring House. I was inspired to do this after seeing Sam and Colby’s video on the Conjuring House and not believeing that it was real, but man was I wrong. The Conjuring House was by far the scariest place I’ve ever been and the paranormal and ghost activity there was unreal. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

I’ve always been amazed by illusions and science experiments that make the impossible possible. That’s why when I saw my friends Ben Azelart and Stokes Twins doing videos to bust 100 myths in 24 hours or break 100 rules in 24 hours, I got the idea to do 100 science experiments in 24 hours! These experiments were way harder to do than I expected. Countless failures on mulitple of the experiments, but I’m so proud we were able to make everything happen. We may also be the first person to do 3 different elephant toothpaste experiments in one video! Not to mention the world’s largest paper machet volcano, turning an aluminum can to plastic, and sending G Fuel to space! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

MrBeast just hit 100 million subscribers so to celebrate I decided to build Jimmy Donaldson a replica of his red diamond play button, but 100 times bigger! In order to make things perfect, I secretly sunk into his massive warehouse and took a 3d scan of the play button. Then me and the Beem Team scaled it up and made it massive. We even had to call in special helper Uncle Dave to teach us to weld! In the end MrBeast was stoked with out it turned out and I couldn’t be happier. Now Jimmy will have to find somewhere to put it lol.  This was an insanely stressful and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching!

After being humbled by the worlds most expensive airplane seat, I decided to travel across the world to Thailand to experience the World’s Cheapest 5-Star Hotel. This journey took us 36 hours to travel from Denver to Phuket, Thailand for one of the best experiences of my life. Not only did this room have multiple living spaces, but it also had my own private pool and a 5-star dining experience. To top things off I hiked to a massive Budda statue, went on a boat tour to the most beautiful islands in the world, even got to swim with elephants! This whole trip was absolutely amazing and I can’t wait to go back to Thailand. This experience was insane and super amazing to make, but we also had lots of laughs along the way.

Ever since I was little I've dreamed of being a superhero, but I - like many of you - was not lucky enough to be blessed with superhuman athletic ability. So in this video I finally live our my childhood dreams by fighting alongside 50 Spidermen. Unexpectedly, Big Matt got taken by a super villain and I had to train to become a full fledged superhero to get him back. My friend @zealous served as my mentor until I was ready to take down the evil villain. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next!

I used to love to watch SpongeBob Squarepants growing up so I felt that it was only fitting that I built the world's largest real life Bikini Bottom in my backyard including a pineapple house for SpongeBob, rock dome for Patrick Star, and Stonehenge house for Squidward Tentacles in a previous video. However, I never got around to building the Chum Bucket so that’s exactly what I’m doing in this video! You might know that there is a real life golden SpongeBob house in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, but it costs $3,800 to stay PER NIGHT and no one can afford that so the next best option was to build a realy life Bikini Bottom in my backyard. This video was super nostalgic to make and we had a lot of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and I can't wait for you to see what's happening next Tuesday.

Ever since I was a kid I’ve been a gamer, but lately it has been hard to find the time. I also may or may not still live with my mom so I feel guilty gaming while at home. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under the stairs in a hidden closet so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom didn’t find out about this project, I sent her and my sister to Paris for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Ever since I was little, I’ve been obsessed with Spider-Man and have always wondered what it would be like to be him. I’ve gone to great lengths to find out what it is like – from hiring 50 Spider-Man to training like Spiderman for 24 hours. Unfortunately, I just didn’t have the skills to cut it in the real world. That why when I saw Ryan Trahan’s videos titled “I Spent 100 Days in the Metaverse” and “I Spent 100 Days in Grand Theft Auto” I knew I had to try out being Spider-Man in VR! Only problem was that I have never used virtual reality before, so this was quite the learning curve. Once I got in the game I learned that it is really easy to do epic GTA 5 ragdolls as Spiderman and it’s very hard to actually use powers for good. I also found out that Venom was wreaking havoc and needed to be stopped. Therefore, I had to train up my Spiderman skills to defeat Venom and save the town! This was insane and super intense to make, but I had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Since November 2022, Russia has been releasing water from the Kakhovka Dam, thereby draining the reservoir behind it. This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north. But it also hints at the possibility that Russia is running low on soldiers, otherwise Moscow would not be willing to incur these costs.

On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. One of the principal targets was Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Most outside observers, including U.S. intelligence, believed that the political center of would fall quickly. But as the hours turned to days, and the days turned to weeks, Ukraine proved that Kyiv would not fall so easily.

But the story of how Kyiv survived is complicated. A combination of Russian miscalculations and clever Ukrainian strategy made the difference. The dreaded 64-kilometer Russian Kyiv convoy fell apart, giving Ukraine a fighting chance for the rest of the war. This is the story of the Battle of Kyiv.

Why did Russia miscalculate so badly in its invasion of Ukraine? The answer is more than two decades in the making. Putin's Persistent and intentional decay of Russia's institutions made it impossible for Russia's intelligence community and military to provide quality information to him. Facing the uncertainty---and wagering that it would take a true disaster for it have a deep effect on him personally---Putin pulled the trigger.

Thus far, neither Ukraine nor Russia has made much progress during the winter. What is actually going on? This video surveys four possibilities.

On the other extreme, Russia may be engaging in a true counter-counterattack, and Ukraine will soon be put on its backfoot. We may also just be observing winter or a true stalemate.

Although we are still many steps away from serious nuclear problems, the groundwork for concerns has been laid. This video explains what tactical nuclear weapons do, how Russia might try to deploy them, and what might deter Putin from taking such steps.

There is this idea floating around that what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. That surviving a disease leaves you better off. And it seems to make sense because we have all experienced  this. When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult situation in the future. But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 
So, what happens when you get sick?

You are cells. Your muscles, organs, skin and hair. They are in your blood and in your bones.
Cells are biological robots. They don’t want anything, they don’t feel anything. They are never sad or happy. They just are, right here, right now. They are as conscious as a stone or a chair or a neutron star. Cells just follow their programming that has been evolving and changing for billions of years, molded by natural selection. 
They are impossible machines and yet, here they are, driven entirely by the fundamental forces of the universe. The smallest unit of life, right at the border where physics becomes biology. 
Sometimes, to get a truer understanding of how amazing something is, you need to hold your breath and dive in really  deep. So, what are cells and how do they work?

The Brain Eating Amoeba
A war has been going on for billions of years that breeds well armed monsters who struggle with other monsters for survival. Having no particular interest in us, most of them are relatively harmless, as our immune systems deal with their weapons handily. But there are exceptions. 
Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba that not only has developed a deadly taste for human brains but is also a match for our defenses and a guest in dramatic headlines. What happens when this monster enters your body?

If you are like most people, there is a gap between the person you are and the person you wish to be. There are little things you think you should do and big things you ought to achieve.
From working out regularly, eating healthy, learning a language, working on your novel, reading more or simply actually doing your hobby instead of browsing reddit.
But it can seem that to achieve your goals, you have to become a different person. Someone who is consistent, puts in more effort, has discipline and willpower. Maybe you have tried your hardest to be like that. And it worked! For a while. Until you find yourself slipping back into your old ways. In the end, you always seem to fail. And with every failed attempt, you become more and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. 
If you believe “success and hustle” internet, it is all your own fault: if you don't succeed, you just didn’t want it enough and the failure is all you. But change is actually hard. But as with most things in life, understanding why makes things easier.

The future of humanity seems insecure. Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight. But humans always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. 
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants. What makes this worse is that we actually may live at an extremely critical moment in human history. To understand why, let us look at the temporal window of humanity and ask:
When will the last human be born and how many people will there ever be?

When we think about alien civilizations we tend to look into the vastness of space, to far away planets. But there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be giving too little thought to: time.
Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years, other civilizations existed on earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out? And that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet? What does science have to say about this and what are the implications for us?

The Earth is a gigantic ball of semi-molten rock, with a heart of iron as hot as the surface of the Sun. Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up. Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface. Earth’s crust is the only thing in their way. It feels solid to us, but it is only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth. True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined, subjecting the climate to centuries  worth of change in a single year, while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases: supervolcanoes. How big can they get? And will they put an end to humanity?

In the 1970s thousands of Chickenheads rained from the sky in Europe, making foxes and other wildlife confused and very happy. Why? They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity – since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all. 
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage, and has been haunting us for at least 4000 years. It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water. But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is, but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses.

At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 30 % of the world’s population, and in many ways the pinnacle of human advancement. Rome became the first city in history to reach one million inhabitants and was a center of technological, legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible to topple, stable and rich and powerful.
Until it wasn’t anymore. First slowly then suddenly, the most powerful civilization on earth collapsed. If this is how it has been over the ages, what about us today? Will we lose our industrial technology, and with that our greatest achievements, from one dollar pizza to smartphones or laser eye surgery? Will all this go away too?

The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions of stars and planets and in the middle of it all there is earth, with you and us. 
But as enormous as the universe seems looking up, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are towering over worlds within worlds, within worlds – each in plain sight and yet hidden from your experience.
Let’s go on a journey – we’ll start in a park, about a thousand meters long, enough for a 15 minute walk. Every time we click a magic button, we’ll become a thousand times smaller.  Ready? Let’s go.

Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes. Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy. But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it.

This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy – a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that is working to expand clean-energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions.

Climate Change is just too much. There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless. 

We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it  so hard to just stop emitting these gases?

Friends make life good. They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun. They give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness. Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.

But maybe you have scrolled through your phone, unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with or ask for comfort. You may realize that you don’t have enough friends and feel lonely. And it is not just you. Disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread. 

Many people want more close friends but don’t know how to get them.

Black hole stars may have been the largest stars to ever exist. They burned brighter than galaxies and were Larger than any star today or that could ever exist in the future. But besides their scale, what makes them special and weird is that deep inside, they were occupied by a cosmic parasite, an endlessly hungry black hole. How is that even possible?

Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions. But… where is all of that? While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up. 

In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it. If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left. In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning. Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.

Today we are answering an age-old very scientific and important question: What if the moon crashes into earth? It’s more interesting and weird than you probably think. Let's start with the basics: Why isn't the Moon on its way to crash into us already?

But let us go back to the beginning…

In and out, in and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells you are breathing.
Breathing is an answer to a very hard problem: How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive, from the outside, to the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem and the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life: Size.

Un Amor Como Este

Jálese compa Luis R Conriquez¡
Y Puro Grupo Firme! Pariente
Ahí te va, chiquita batallosa

Me vas a extrañar
Olvidarme no está tan pelada
No son enchiladas dejar de pensar en mi
Me vas a extrañar
Te aseguro que vas a buscarme
Yo aquí voy a esperarte
¿Quién soy yo pa decir que no?
Y es que los besos en tu boca saben mejor
Sabes que eres mía y yo tuyo
Solo que estás enojada
Ven yo te contento y pronto se te pasa
Yo aquí estoy tranquilo
Te doy chanza que te vayas y lo pienses
Y verás que no hay un amor como este
Porque solo yo, porque solo yo sé como quererte 

Sabes que eres mía y yo tuyo
Solo que estás enojada
Ven yo te contento y pronto se te pasa
Yo aquí estoy tranquilo
Te doy chanza que te vayas y lo pienses
Y verás que no hay un amor como este
Porque solo yo, porque solo yo sé como quererte

Letra 
Es muy fácil dar tu opinión
Sin estar en mis zapatos
Hace rato que no, 
que no tenemos un trato

Para ti es muy fácil decir
Que ya pasó y que lo superé
Que fue un simple amor
Que a los recuerdos ni me aferré

Para mí fuiste más que un simple amor
Fuiste el pasado que jamás regresó
Hoy me cuesta soltarte
Te amé como a nadie
El terco aquí es mi corazón
Si en tu vida prioridad nunca fui yo
¿Qué hago?

¿Y ahora, como le digo a mi corazón?
Que ya no puedo con esto
Me quema por dentro
Aquí ya no mando yo
No hay solución
Tú te ves muy feliz
Yo no hallo la puerta
Y aún sigo pensando en ti

¿Y ahora, como le digo a mi corazón?
Que solo fuimos tu juego
Que nada en tu vida significo
El que falló fui yo
Por exponerlo sin pensar las consecuencias
Que a veces tiene el amor

(¡Y puro Grupo Firme!)

¿Y ahora, como le digo a mi corazón?
Que ya no puedo con esto
Me quema por dentro
Aquí ya no mando yo
No hay solución
Tú te ves muy feliz
Yo no hallo la puerta
Y aún sigo pensando en ti

¿Y ahora como le digo a mi corazón?
Que solo fuimos tu juego
Que nada en tu vida significo
El que falló fui yo
Por exponerlo sin pensar las consecuencias
Que a veces tiene el amor

VIDEO INFO
Howdy friends! In this video, we begin our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence for it.

ADDENDUM: At 48:00 I mistakenly class the Zigurrat at Ur as a burial structure. In reality, the Ziggurat was a temple to the Goddess of the moon. In research I got this crossed with the Royal Cemetary at Ur. Thank you to all who caught this miscategorization.

254,5z3DbmOuaFI,Were Homo Sapiens the First Hominid in North America? A Deep Dive into the Cerutti Mastodon Site,"In this video we take a dive into the mysterious archaeological site known as the Cerutti Mastodon. This site in Southern California dates back a shocking 130,000 years, nearly 100,000 years older than the next oldest evidence of human habitation of the Americas. By this point there is no archaeological evidence that Homo Sapiens had migrated out of Africa yet. Is it possible that Homo Sapiens were not the first human to make it across the Bering Land Bridge and into the lush forests of Pleistocene North America? Come along as we explore the intricacies of one of the most hotly debated archaeological sites in the country and the site of the mysterious Cerutti mastadon.

VIDEO INFO:
In this video we delve into the world we live in as seen through the eyes of a historian from 1855. We will see all sorts of views that have aged about as poorly as a view can, from the conquest and colonization of North America to the decimation of Indigenous populations. While the views are abhorrent by todays standards, it gives us a perfect opportunity to see how far we have come, how far we have yet to go, and how to crack a couple jokes along the way.

Video Info:
In this video we make a rock sling to sling rocks. Many rocks and slings are slung as we explore this ancient and archaic piece of ranged weaponry. While the history of this ancient device is contested, we know it dates back at least to the ancient Fertile Crescent and is likely to have been invented far before that but due to being made of natural fibers left no surviving evidence. Here I will teach you how to make a rock sling of your own as well as let you experience the horror that is learning to use one for yourself.

VIDEO INFO:
Howdy Friends! In this video we spend an afternoon exploring the ancient shores of Lake Champlain in the state of Vermont. Our adventure brings us to Isle La Mott, a small island just north of the city of Burlington, which contains remnants of the Chazy Fossil Reef. Registered as a National National Landmark in 2009, the Chazy Fossil Reef is the oldest fossil reef in the world dating back more than 450 million years. It contains the fossilized remains of bivalves, corals and other ancient marine life that once lived in the warm shallow seas of Ordovician earth. We also discuss the Pleistocene glacial history of Lake Champlain from the Champlain Sea to the way that indigenous groups likely survived in this environment. Come along with me as we take a 450 million year walk down memory lane.

Howdy friends,
In this video I discuss Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark with John X Smith and 1UPWHATUP on the Movie Rant Break podcast. We obviously get highly tangential so you will get to see a wonderful sampling of talking about all kinds of conspiracies, archaeological theories and practices as well as getting to the core of why conspiracy sells. Id like to thank each and every one of you for watching this slightly different video and I hope you enjoy.

Id like to give a HUGE thank you to AkariKuzu for helping me search for the conspiracy videos which I review in this episode.

I also want to thank my incredible mods, GeorgeTheBarbarian, Deus, Gizmo, Thesaurus Rex, Aidan, Charli, Raven, Liekki, Callisto, Proserpina, Paperflesh and Regina George

In this video we go down the rabbit hole of the conspiracies surrounding the Dendera Light motif at the temple of Hathor at Dendera. From ancient aliens to Norwegian electricians this story is a roller coaster. Join me for the ride as I debunk it all.

A Special thanks to Dr. Chris Barnhart. Dr. Barnhart’s video and pictures of freshwater mussels are impossible to miss if you research them even a little bit. Dr. Barnhart let us share his  incredible (and hilarious) documentation of these amazing animals, and helped us avoid silly mistakes (like mispronouncing the entire Order). We would not have been able to make this episode without him.

Dr. Winfried Peters:
Dr. Peters spent hours sorting through his research and sending me notes and files. His research is what got me excited about O.semistriatta and I can't be more grateful to have had his help. I have listed a number of his papers further below, and I have made a donation to leatherbacktrust.org in his name.

Nathan was extremely helpful and generous with his time and footage and gave my early script a once over. His research is pretty amazing - on turtles and the giant squid. His hermit crab video is so great in its entirety. Sub to his channels!

LiquidGuru is a pro. Just gets such beautiful views into Aquatic life! His juvenile Orbicular Batfish is so well done.

There is also a wonderful resource on Mudskippers at http://www.themudskipper.org/
run by Gianluca Polgar, who was kind enough to point out two mistakes i made in this video:
 - At min 1.43-1.49: that is a blenny of the genus Andamia, not a mudskipper.
 - Not all mudskippers have fused pelvic fins that are used as suckers

Aside from calling a dolphin a fish - which i actually find kind of funny in context :)

In This Video, i randomized Pokemon Platinum, and gave myself only 50 pokeballs. Whichever pokemon I caught, i HAD to buy. I CANNOT RUN FROM POKEMON, which made this video.... Very expensive. I AM GOING TO FILL MY BACKGROUND WITH EVERY GENERATION OF POKEMON!

Pm7 and I both bought a Booster Box of the Astral Radiance Pokémon set, and we created our own sort of challenge! We take all the ""Ultra Packs"" and open them to see who's pull was better, and all the Non Ultra-Packs that we opened before them go to the winner. At the end, whoever won more rounds gets a Booster Box of the NEWEST Pokemon set!

I hired 10 Pokemon Shiny Hunters to catch me as MANY Shiny Pokemon as they could in a 6 hour time period. For every shiny pokemon they caught, they got $50. I will be giving all of these shiny pokemon away through Wonder Trade on a Livestream here on this channel! If you miss the stream, don't worry it will be made into a video.

update from jack: Hey everyone! I got to spend a lot of December and January travelling around the world and coming up with the video i really want to make this year. Our calendar is STACKED, and i really hope you enjoy the upcoming videos as much as i do :)

413,ysd5-uTLy6w,How I Beat SONS OF THE FOREST... With Only A Stick! - A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits,"Welcome to Sons Of The Forest! The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! 

Today I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! 

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience.

Effectively we are going to build The City of London 2. As you can tell this is not going to be your standard simcity city builder experience but rather a montage of exploiting cities skylines to break the new dlc and allow us to create the most profitable city possible with basically no effort. Now we have seen RT Game destroy cities with his powers as a mayor but I am a pro player when it comes to sim city and city building in general so get ready to watch as the spiffing brit beats all other records by using bugs and exploits to win. 

The following was written by an Ai because I think its funny:
In this video, I show you how I exploit the suffering of my city in Cities Skylines to make infinite money. I show you the in-game mechanics I use to do this, and how you can do the same.If you're a city builder or city planner, this is a must-watch video! I show you how I use game mechanics to exploit the suffering of my city, and how you can do the same in your own city. I also reveal some tips on how to make the most of your city, and how to make money playing city builder or city planner games!

Hello there ladies and gentlemen today something magical is about to happen today in todays video! The Spiffing Brit today attempts to play the 2008 classical game that is Spore. A game so unique that it took miracle video game god Will Wright to create a perfect game that inspired a generation of gamers before the release of minecraft. Welcome to Spore! Spore is a evolution game where you start as a single cell object and as you eat, you gain DNA and abilities! The only issue is today we will be seeing if you can beat spore by creating a religion of tea fanatics that can convert planets instantly thanks to a spore exploit! This will allow us to ally with the grox the main villains of spore. It will once and for all prove that spore is a perfectly balanced game which can for some reason be beaten by bypassing the core gameplay loop of designing planets to slowly produce spice and setting up trade routes. And for some reason we are able to go from cell stage to creature stage to tribal stage to civilization stage and finally the space stage and find that the space stage is now very funny to play!  

So today we will ally the grox everyones favourite spore cyborg creators of warcrimes! Whilst IGN might rate this gameplay poorly I however love the memes that can be created with a perfectly balanced spore glitch! 

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. So reject your ign memes and get ready for some insane gameplay from anything from vic 3 to broken skyrim mods.

Can you scam an entire data centre into buying milk at 3X the regular price? And why does the spiffing brit keep hoarding thavnarian chai tea! Is the economy of ff14 perfectly balanced or is a basic understanding of supply and demand economics necessary to make millions without even understanding or playing the game! So join me just in time for a newfound adventure bringing new free company houses that will require stupid amounts of gil to buy! Luckily using economics we have found a way to get Infinite Money! So lets dive into a world of Final Fantasy xiv and ride off the endwalker hype and the fans asmongold managed to bring into the game!

Now what does the spiffing brit do with brand new rts games well he finds exploits in their perfectly balanced game design however this time EVERYTHING IS BROKEN! As the AI does not even function when given the challenge of moving across water. Age of empires has always been at the forefront of AI design in strategy games however for some reason Age Of Empires 3: Definitive Edition a 2020 strategy game has been released with AI reminiscent of an early 2000s strategy game. So naturally we will be seeing if Age Of Empires 3: Definitive Edition Is A Perfectly Balanced Game Without exploits or if perhaps the fact EVERYTHING is broken might upset the perfect game balance necessary in any top strategy game of 2020. I really hope that ahead of age of empires 4 we can get a bit of a magical rework of the AI to get a good challenge out of it on all the map types!

Have you ever tried to settle a city but cant because your settlers instantly burst into flames as soon as they step out of your city? What about trying to do a civ war but your entire army just stood on top of the worlds largest earthquake. The result is a perfectly balanced game. This is without a doubt the most hostile and dangerous civ world I have ever created so why not give it a go! 

Today the game is going to become a hardcore and impossible game so no amount of infinite gold and science exploits that are overpowered and break the game will ultimately make a difference when everything you build can be burnt down each turn! So sure you can do your civ 6 deity challenge with the new civ 6 leader pass or instead you could survive the impossible game! 

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.

Today I transform my boring useless performance sports car into a superior High speed tea brewing device! Normal kettles can boil water in 120 seconds this kettle can go 60 mph in just 3 seconds! Did I mention that todays video is also sponsored by YORKSHIRE TEA! That is right they actually decided to pay me to wrap my car and convert it into a high speed tea brewing machine! They even gave me access to little urn the mobile tea brewing truck to do a drag race and see which mobile kettle is the fastest! 

I honestly cannot believe that I the greatest tea drinker in the world now gets the opportunity to break my own made up world records and speedrun the tea brewing process by modding my car into well a kettle! This isnt a normal tea review this is me creating the fastest car (in terms of brewing a british tea) without having any mechanical experience or skills to do it! This car went from a boring tetley tea to an enlightened yorkshire gold that could destroy a guiness world record speedrun if it even existed! Funny It truly is perfectly Balanced.

*Excluding all the other fastest kettles...

Welcome back to cyberpunk 2077 where 2 years after release I have decided to return to the game! 2 Years later the game of cyberpunk has seen many patches and hot fixes as well as new content! Well I say new content. Most of it is features that were promised to be added into the release however were just some classic todd howard fabrications. So naturally 2 years on the game should have no bugs or glitches! So much to my surprise no this game is absolutely rammed with issues, exploits and glitches that plague all versions of this game. There are still infinite health glitches that create god mode. There are infinite money exploits that allow you to fabricate easily a million euro dollars. With overpowered quick hacks you can 1 hit entire armies of troops with digital plagues. There is still no balance to this game and it is still absurdly easy to break it. Becoming overpowered is easy but becoming a true god and breaking this game is not! So today I decided to become a god and break the games files to truly perfectly balance this game and see just how broken cyberpunk can get 2 years after release. 
Now after the release of cyberpunk edgerunners more and more people will dive into the world of cyberpunk 2077 exploit discovery!

427,hX_qyf38X9c,Can I Survive 100 Days in Hardcore Survival Mode? - Perfectly Balanced Skyrim Challenge #Attempt2,"Welcome back to skyrim! Where today we set out on a second attempt of an impossible challenge! Can you beat the survive 100 days in skyrim hardcore challenge? The rules are simple, Legendary difficulty skyrim with survival mode but the added twist that you are not allowed to equip any Armor or weapons. This is the hardest possible challenge skyrim can offer. You are effectively playing at 1 hp and almost anything will kill you and fail the run. Ontop of that in survival mode you must eat and sleep similarly to an indie survival game. You must also balance temperatures which in the cold northern lands of skyrim is rather impossible. 

Mod Pack Used: https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/jqd9zz

So sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or surviving 100 days of skyrim hardcore is a task that is simply too impossible for this pro exploiter!

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience.

Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

 His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing;, ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

500,IR9yjn7Lkdg,Ted Lasso — Season 3 Official Trailer | Apple TV+,"All roads have led to this. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso

In the third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them to finish last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.

CRADLE OF FILTH mastermind Dani Filth says about the track:
""This track and the other original track on this album, 'Demon Prince Regent’, were both written after the recording of Existence Is Futile and present a perfect, but not necessarily related, bridge between our Nuclear Blast days and the forthcoming album on Napalm Records. It was always intended to be a double album, so we just thought, ‘f**k it! Let’s cram some original material on there as well! The absolute worst of both worlds! 
The song itself is about the epitome of burning passion; the dark inspiration of love and the creature that has ignited it.""",2023-03-01 15:00:04+00:00,14.875654274444448,1,Napalm Records,UCG7AaCh_CiG6pq_rRDNw72A,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fGrxKLsgidg/default.jpg,120,90,348,hd,False,89456,8083.0,0,506.0,"What started out as a one-person operation in a cramped living-room, became one of the biggest record labels of the independent scene.

LYRICS:
Ride, take a ride
On the Tekkno train right now, take your seat
Open up, feel the pounding bass deep inside ya

Shaky, shaky, sweaty ,sweaty
You make my spaghetti ready
Heat up the sauce, it's a dinner for one

You better hold on tight
'Cause we're rolling again
Through the wet lands down where the nature is plain
And when it's getting messy I'm taking the blame
'Cause I need you to stay on my Tekkno train

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

Destination, love
P-p-pleasure up above
You really can't stop the heat
I got lipstick on my feet, uh

Licky, licky, sucky, sucky
Yeah, you make my lolly poppy
Candy time, go get your dinner for one

You better go stuff your face
Before it's too late
'Cause they're standing in line
To have a piece of the cake
And when the feast is over, you'll see us again
Next week, same time on the Tekkno train

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

Your attention please
The 69 EC service Tekkno train on platform A-M-P and V
To Climax City is arriving ahead of schedule
We're sorry for any lost enjoyment

I'm gonna take it right now, hand it over
This ride is free but I really need to feel it now
Hand it over
Boom, boom, pow, there you go

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo
We're riding on the Tekkno train 

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo
We're riding out of town

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

The inspiration behind this video: 

While the new trailer for The Flash debuts the DCU's brand-new Supergirl, her origins may be taking inspiration from another major comic story beyond Flashpoint. Played by Sasha Calle, this new version of Superman's cousin will come onto the scene during a collision of worlds thanks to the unintentional efforts of Barry Allen's Flash. However, some interesting teases suggest Supergirl's debut will resemble one of DC's greatest Elseworlds stories from the comics.

The clashing of timelines seen in The Flash trailer is all inspired by DC's Flashpoint by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert. In the comic, Barry Allen wakes up to a massively altered reality, one in which he has no powers, and the lives of the Justice League have been massively changed. This all stems from his decision to go back in time and save his mother from being murdered, a moment that created a massive domino effect. As such, this is the basic framework The Flash will be working with, though it looks like Supergirl's origin will also adapt elements of a classic Superman story from Mark Millar.

Sin embargo, hace aproximadamente 66 millones de años, nuestro planeta volvió a cambiar de habitantes. Una catástrofe global, cuyos detalles se desconocen hasta el día de hoy, acabó con casi todos los animales de más de 25 kg, que habitaban la faz de la Tierra; además, en un lapso relativamente corto de tiempo, de acuerdo a los estándares geológicos. Los espacios desocupados fueron ocupados rápidamente por nuevos habitantes: mamíferos. Luego, éstos últimos, en el curso de una lucha constante por la supervivencia, dieron lugar a más y más formas nuevas de vida, hasta el nacimiento de una criatura única. En lugar de aceptar con sumisión las reglas de la naturaleza, esta criatura decidió construir sus propias reglas. No era el más grande, el más fuerte o el más rápido. Entonces, ¿Cómo se convirtió en el ""rey de la naturaleza""?

673,hebWYacbdvc,The Flash – Official Trailer,"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash – only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie 

Warner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.

Worlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? 

“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).

“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers 
are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.

Joining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch 
(“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.",2023-02-12 22:59:38+00:00,414.88287649666665,31,Warner Bros.

Otgo loves their life, in harmony with nature and old traditions. Yet she dreams of becoming a dancer at the opera house in Ulan Bator.

In Mongolia, it is becoming increasingly common for the younger generation to leave traditional life behind. Otgo’s dream would take her far from her family’s yurt. She wants to become a dancer and later, a dance teacher. Her parents leave it up to her to decide how she wants to shape her life. They agree to support her, if she embarks on her great endeavor. In the meantime, Otgo has become an almost indispensable help to the family. She gets up early in the morning to water the camels with her father, and it fills her with pride that she can help her family. The breathtaking landscape of the Gobi Desert and the strong bonds between the different nomadic families do not make it easy for Otgo to follow her dream.

Otgo’s story paints a portrait of her world and of the men and women who have long passed on their culture from generation to generation, through the eyes of a child.

707,bS-gsJNCOtM,Shocking Discovery at the Well of Abraham: Tradition vs Archaeology,"In this video, we embark on a journey to solve the mystery of the ancient well believed to be dug by Abraham himself. With competing claims from another tourist site just miles away, we had to dig deep to uncover the truth. But what we found at Tel Beersheba left us absolutely stunned! With the help of a 19th-century explorer's book, we reveal more evidence that points to the true location of Beersheba. Buckle up and join us on this thrilling adventure as we explore this ancient land and unravel the secrets of Abraham's Well.

719,_C73ZZkFiUM,"Super Bowl Reactions, Tears of Joy & the Fan Base Name Revealed | New Heights | Ep 28","On the twenty-eighth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball, this is the definitive recap of Super Bowl 57. 

Jason and Travis weigh in on what they thought of the field conditions during pre-game warm-ups, seeing Donna Kelce on the jumbotron, what they were feeling during the anthem, and if there was any shit-talking during the coin toss. 

We then break down the game itself starting with a very Kelce-centric first quarter, how the Eagles responded to a huge turnover, and what adjustments the Chiefs made in the locker room down 10 at halftime. 

We also touch on the Chiefs starting the second half strong, how the Chiefs tied it all up with a play called “corn dog,” the third down play that Jason is still thinking about, Jalen Hurts clutch 4th quarter drive to tie the game, and Travis walks us through the Chiefs go-ahead field goal to clinch Super Bowl 57. 

Jason and Travis then give their final thoughts on the game’s “controversial” ending, the enormous emotions they were feeling seeing their family on the field, and Jason reveals the one thing that could have made this the greatest Super Bowl of all time. 

After the game discussion, we finally have Travis make his pick for the long-awaited name of the New Heights fan base, answer a not-dumb question about casting the inevitable “Kelce Bowl” movie and talk a little bit about what we have planned next for the show. 

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

As tough as its reputation may be, Dark Souls tries its best to give brand new players a helping hand as they find their barings in its hardcore world - unfortunately, the manner Dark Souls does this... accidentally tricks people into playing in a cowardly, risk averse way - meaning they have less fun, and are less willing to try and master the game's intricacies.

Entry Level Strategies are a powerful and crucial tool that allow videogames to ease in beginner players, but sometimes, they're too helpful for their own good, and end up ruining otherwise great games - how do they do this? and how did Elden Ring finally fix From Soft's most persistent design problem? One thing's for sure, in order to solve this particular conundrum, the Architect is going to need more than that 100% block shield they've been carrying around since the start of the game.

Many people consider HP Lovecraft's work as a fore runner for modern horror fiction as his work served as a pioneer for many horror genres and styles to come. With his out of the box strangeness and almost instantly recognizable style, his distinct work has become ubiquitous in the history of horror.

📜 - - - DESCRIPTION - - - 📜
There are 9 legendary armaments in Elden Ring. Not all of them are legendary. In fact, some of them can be argued as suboptimal. Perhaps even disastrously, tragically inept. Some of them are outclassed by ordinary ""blue"" armaments, while others seem to be in a class of their own. I've run out of things to summarize about this video.

731,tdZ-RcLf5JQ,Elden Ring Lore | Deep Dive Into the Starting Classes,"The Tarnished were all once warriors but beyond that they have a complex history. Tarnished Hunters, Prophets who have seen the flame and inheritors of the Blind Swordsman. The Starting classes of Elden Ring each hold a story (mostly) that can provide a great bedrock of Lore. 

Intro: 0:00
Confessor: 1:25
Warrior: 6:17
Samurai: 12:19
Astrologer: 16:55
Prophet: 22:03
Hero: 25:37
Prisoner: 27:13
Vagabond, Bandit and Wretch: 33:20
Final Thoughts: 35:46

I found this to be a worthwhile subject as the starting classes are excellent on informing us about the cultures, crime, history and scope of the lands between as well as the nature of the Tarnished themselves.

767,Bd78wBDHALI,Israel's Problem with Russia is an Absolute Nightmare,"Why is Israel in a position where they are kind of forced to play nice with Russia, and how is Putin’s new relationship with Tehran driving Israel away? The war in Ukraine has clearly put new stress on this strange relationship. 

Written by: Chris Cappy & Patrick Griffin 
Edited by: Savvy Studios 

But something major has changed the relationship with Russia and Israel in an unexpected way. The Abraham accords announced in August 2020 completely rewrote the security relationships in the middle east. It was passed under US President Trump the Abraham accords was an effort to “encourage efforts to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue to advance a culture of peace among the three Abrahamic religions and all humanity.” The deal received bipartisan support in America and led to new forms of cooperation between two of the states that signed on Israel and the United Araba Emirates. but other muslim countries also improved relations with Israel like Azerbaijan and Sudan. 

Why is that? According to Israel's Ministry of Defense, the value of Israeli defense exports to countries with which it normalized relations in 2020 reached $791 million. Nothing gets rid of thousands of years of fighting like getting together and trading weapons. In fact between 2016–2020, Israel arms imports to Azerbaijan made up about 70 percent of their major weapon imports — and about 17 percent of Israel's arms exports. Add on Bahrain, Morocco, and Eygpt all normalizing relations with Israel and you’ve got a real coombya moment worthy of your aunts coexist bumper sticker.  There’s a new Israeli-Arab-US security order in the middle east aimed against Iran. Common enemy, check, weapons deals check, common favorite spread check.

Even in the heavyweight division, where he dreamed of fighting Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, or Lennox Lewis, Jones owned the WBA belt. But negotiations fell through. He refused a fight with Vitali Klitschko himself, deciding instead to return to his usual light heavyweight. But Antonio Tarver already ruled there, and he had promised the whole world to dispel the myth of Jones' impeccable defense.

ABOUT 'GOT TALENT'
Got Talent is a British talent show TV format developed by Simon Cowell's SYCOtv company and owned by Fremantle Media Ltd. It has spawned spin-offs in over 70 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by Fremantle of the 'Idol' and 'The X Factor' singing show competition formats. Unlike those shows, Got Talent showcases a wide variety of artistic disciplines in addition to singing.

'Got Talent' was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by Guinness World Records. Cowell stated, “I am very proud that Got Talent is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen. And of course amazing talent.”

811,do-cLmRhz0E,"Colbert vs Garcia FULL FIGHT: February 26, 2022 | PBC on Showtime","(February 26, 2022) Late replacement Hector Garcia battered and dropped the highly-touted Chris Colbert on his way to earning a unanimous decision in a 12-round WBA Super Featherweight World Title Eliminator.

Late replacement Hector Garcia performed like the world champion he was substituting for on Saturday night, battering and dropping the highly touted Chris Colbert to earn a unanimous decision in a 12-round WBA Super Featherweight World Title Eliminator that headlined a thrilling tripleheader live on SHOWTIME in a Premier Boxing Champions event from The Chelsea inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.
 
Garcia (15-0, 10 KOs) stepped in for the WBA Super Featherweight World Champion Roger Gutierrez less than three weeks ago after Gutierrez was forced to withdraw due to a positive COVID-19 test. Despite having little time to prepare, the southpaw Garcia used his height and powerful left hand to dominate Colbert (16-1, 6 KOs) by scores of 118-109, 118-109, and 119-108.  
 
“I have to thank everyone in my corner, Ismael Salas and Bob Santos, and everyone that worked with me,” said Garcia. “I feel great. I definitely knew three weeks ago that my life would change. My trainers gave me the confidence to win this fight.”
 
“I’m sorry I let everyone down, today he was the better man,” Colbert said afterward, his arm draped around Garcia in an encouraging embrace. “I take my losses like I take my wins. I want to run it back and hopefully we can do it again. There’s no excuses. He was the better man today.”
 
Garcia was the aggressor throughout, dropping Colbert for the first time in his career with a counter left in the seventh round that caused Colbert to fall backwards, his legs flying up in the air from the momentum. Colbert got to his feet, but Garcia jumped on him again, stalking him around the ring.
 
“In the ninth and 10th rounds I hit him so hard,” said Garcia. “I knew I had him. I knew he wasn’t going to be able to box anymore.”
 
Colbert could never get on track and showed little of the aggression and skills that made him one of the most talked about young fighters in the sport. 
 
“Everyone puts pressure on me in the ring,” said Colbert. “That’s nothing new. I want to get a rematch if I can. Congratulations to Hector and his team. They deserved this win tonight. I wasn’t feeling myself. At the end the day, I’m still ‘Primetime’ on SHOWTIME.”
 
In the end it was Garcia, a 2016 Dominican Olympian, who performed like the favored fighter, punishing Colbert and pushing him back and potentially earning a title shot against Gutierrez.
 
“I want to fight Gutierrez for the world championship,” Garcia said. “I worked too hard to get into this position today.”

835,ymGt7I4Yn3k,Russell's Paradox - a simple explanation of a profound problem,"This is a video lecture explaining Russell's Paradox. At the very heart of logic and mathematics, there is a paradox that has yet to be resolved. It was discovered by the mathematician and philosopher, Bertrand Russell, in 1901. In this talk, Professor Jeffrey Kaplan teaches you the basics of set theory (a foundational branch of mathematics dating back to the 1870s) in 20 minutes. Then he explains Russell’s Paradox, which is quite a thrilling thing if you are learning it for the first time. Finally, Kaplan argues that the paradox goes even deeper than Russell himself realized.

Also, I should mention Georg Cantor, Gotlob Frege, Logicism, and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in this description for keyword search reasons.",2022-09-08 15:18:27+00:00,4190.569265385556,0,Jeffrey Kaplan,UC_hukbByJP7OZ3Xm2tszacQ,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymGt7I4Yn3k/default.jpg,120,90,1708,hd,False,1944400,32361.0,0,7227.0,"I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

836,2OlcxUQ4jgM,Why Does The Universe Exist? Fan Grab Bag With Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Why does the universe exist? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice answer fan questions about black holes, wormholes, the expansion of the universe and more! What are our options to solve the crisis in cosmology?

Can we answer the question: why does the universe exist? We discuss the meaning of life and get scientific and philosophical with it. Is it all just physics? What happens to matter when it reaches the singularity and not just the event horizon? Learn about Hawking radiation and spaghettification and the mysteries that still persist. 

What’s the deal with the green comet? Find out about Oort cloud comets and where the comet gets its green. How big does an asteroid have to be to blow an atmosphere off a planet? What would happen if you pointed a laser pointer at a black hole? We explore gravitational redshift, time dilation, as well as how artificial intelligence will perceive the universe. Could we establish a wormhole for interstellar travel?

Discover the Big Rip and where the heat energy emitted from stars goes. Is the universe getting colder? We weigh the options for resolving the crisis in cosmology, how the JWST impacts it, and whether we are alone in the universe.  Plus, find out time travel theories on how the Titanic really sank.

Thanks to our Patrons Fadi Hayek, Kemlyn Brazda, pascale manales, Jules Martin, and Scott Alderman for supporting us this week.

NOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.

Bajo el respaldo de la disquera DEL Records, el músico originario de Culiacán, Sinaloa, México, debutó en 2015 con su álbum de estudio ""Mi conquista"", material que incluye temas como 'La Fuga del jefe"", ""El Famoso Chino Ántrax"" y ""La Vida del Changuito"", entre otras.
 
En 2016, Lenin recibió un premio BMI por el tema ""El Awitado"" interpretado por Jorge Valenzuela y en el 2018, obtuvo su primer galardón de 'Premios de la Radio' por el tema ""Como Los Vaqueros"" mismo que interpreta al lado de otro talento de DEL Records Ulices Chaidez
 
En el 2019, su álbum ""Bendecido"" fue nominado a Premios Lo Nuestro como 'Mejor Álbum Sierreño del año', convirtiéndose así en un pionero de esta importante terna que apenas se abrió en los cotizados premios. Dicha producción se llevó el premio al 'Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano' del 2019

Poco tiempo después, Lenin Ramírez mostró su lado romántico con el lanzamiento de su nuevo sencillo: ""Estas ganas de tomar"". El tema es de la autoría de los talentosos Horacio Palencia y Giovanni Cabrera, en donde se muestra su lado romántico, faceta poco conocida del intérprete originario de Culiacán, Sinaloa y que se ha convertido en un nuevo éxito en la carrera de este talentoso cantante, una de las cartas fuertes de la disquera DEL Records.
 
A la par del lanzamiento de ""Estas ganas de tomar"", el flamante ganador del 'Latin Billboard 2019', en la categoría 'Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano', por su disco ""Bendecido"", también dio a conocer el video oficial del tema, producido por el equipo de producción de DEL Estudios, Lenin Ramírez. El video puede ser visto en el canal de YouTube de DEL Records.
 
Lenin obtuvo una nominación a Los Premios Juventud, dentro del rubro 'La Nueva generación del Regional Mexicano. Además, Ramírez tuvo una destacada participación en conduciendo un segmento del espectáculo.
 
A principios de septiembre, Lenin Ramírez apareció en la lista de nominados a los Latin American Music Awards, en la categoría: 'Álbum Favorito de Regional Mexicano', por su disco: ""Bendecido"".
 
Junto con la salida de ""Seguimos Adelante"", el ganador del Premio Billboard Latino al Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano, lanzó, además, el video de ""El Rata Güera"", un corrido muy ""meneado"" y ""pisteador"", muy al estilo de Ramírez que ya se puede apreciar en el canal de YouTube de DEL Records.

It takes at least four years of production before these ink sticks can be sold, and even longer for the most expensive ones. A 200-gram high-grade ink stick from a producer like Kobaien costs over $1,000. And at some other retailers, prices can reach almost $2,000. Meanwhile, almost double the amount of commercial India ink can go for as little as $9.

Editor's Note: The original version of this video incorrectly named the featured calligrapher as Shijo Azakami. His correct name is Sho Azakami. The original video incorrectly stated that monkey glue was used to make ink sticks, the correct type is donkey glue.

One of the hottest documentaries in the world right now is the Netflix production Ancient Apocalypse, featuring Graham Hancock – but some are calling on Netflix to pull it. Others are wondering how the series could be allowed in the first place. 
What is so bad about the series that it evokes reactions like these?
In this editorial, @AndreEinherjar will begin with a brief introduction of Graham Hancock and his thesis, as well as where he stands on the matter, just so you all have that in mind before we move on to my review of the Netflix series, and why I think the establishment archeology is doing itself a HUGE disfavor with the reaction that we are now seeing!

862,C7TwBUxxIC0,Negative Ion/Anti-5g Products Are Actually RADIOACTIVE,"Ads for negative ion products seem to be all over the place these days and they are all the rage with the ""wellness"" crowd. With wild claims of vague or impossible health benefits, most people chalk it up to just being a scam or just a harmless product designed to separate people from their money.

But the reality is so much worse. Negative ions are a very real thing, but making them takes energy. So how do you make a piece of plastic bracelet keep producing negative ions forever? Well, you fill it with radioactive material. In this video we go through all of the testing I did over the last few months to determine what's in these products and if they're dangerous.

There is so much amazing science and engineering that gets done, but most often the only ones who get to experience it first hand are those in expensive labs in universities. This channel aims to explore as much of fields of science and engineering as possible by showing real experiments and research being done in a fun and accessible way. While the goal is to show that even very hard science can be done in a DIY way, some projects will use some of the fancier toys that while less accessible, opens a broader range of projects that can be done.

-----------------Lyrics----------------
A divine creature 
Ran through dimes, divas 
I turned blocks to beaches 
By the time you see us, we just 
Turned tides even 
Cuban chain, got the largest pieces 
But I’m wild for keepin’ it so timeless 
Almost half a century with a crispy lineup 
My peeps Salaam said I remind him of Martin Lawrence 
Breakin’ hearts on some real thin line sh*t 
I’m done with star chicks, I survived divorces 
I ain’t have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches 
Uh, I ain’t have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches 
I was the ill seed, the illest one 
The villainized, but I feel free 
And the field be 
Crazy way before the drill beef 
Doesn’t matter this is sheer relief, I feel the breeze this is… 
Superhero material, rap star status 
Premier album still might happen 
I wonder why Pete Rock would act like that 
That type of behavior make me give rap right back 
And now I can’t tell if all the good that I did’s bein’ hid with they agenda again, n*gga I know that yall prayin’ I go back to nuttin’ 
We in the future, let’s get past the frontin’ 
Let’s get money 

This is practice 
This is magic 
History, havoc 
Instant classic 
This is madness 
In all fairness 
We been movin’ how you f*ck n*ggas wanna 
My 30 for 30 highlights doin’ numbers 

Goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
I’m goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
We been movin’ how you f*ck n*ggas want 
And my 30 for 30 highlights doin’ numbers 
Woo 

King!

We take a look at the past five years and our journey not having our son Bryce physically with us. It has been almost fourteen years that we have been without him, however we have shared five of those years here on youtube. Thanks for your support and for being a part of our family through all of this.

We share some of our most special traditions that we do to remember Bryce. We love to go visit his headstone and bring special keepsakes to decorate with. We release balloons, play together in the grass, take lots of pictures, and sometimes have a picnic.

""The Bigger Picture"" Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

Damn Kai, you going crazy
I be in the loop, she be in a group (yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
40 thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, why the fuck would you say that?
You can do it first, I'ma do it worse, gotta double the payback
Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

972,Dw0ViHDVhFk,Pokémon Legends Arceus - 1 Year Later (A Retrospective Review),"It has been over a year since the release of Pokemon Legends Arceus. In this video I take a look back at the game that left the community wanting more from the 'Legends' name. In this video, I talk about some of the main features of the game including the story, characters, combat, the good and the bad and what the future of the Legends franchise may look like.

There was a lot of stuff that I could have explored but I feel like I have covered a lot as is, so if you want me to make a follow up video discussing other topics let me know in the comments. Also, if you do enjoy this video, please give it a thumbs up and comment down below what you did or didn’t like about the game. I will be happy to hear your thoughts. 

Thanks for watching and I hope you have a great day!

973,DaUHU2I-haA,How Pokémon Red & Blue Were Made,"This Pokémon documentary details the development of the monster collecting RPG Pokémon Red & Blue and goes behind the scenes of their creation. Discover more about creator Satoshi Tajiri and how his love for bug catching led to the idea for Pokémon. The documentary also explores all the design decisions that development studio Game Freak, which consisted of only nine developers at the time, made and shows how Pokémon trainers were initially going to participate in battles with certain weapons for example.

It also takes a close look at all the hurdles Game Freak had to go through. The title was initially going to be “Capsule Monsters” but it had to be changed multiple times, because it resembled Ultraman’s Capsule Kaiju a little too much. Additionally, reducing over 200 designs for all the Pokémon to their favorite 151 proved to be a bigger challenge than anticipated. Furthermore, there was one moment during development that almost destroyed years of work. Lastly, the developers experienced serious problems when they were localizing Pokémon for various regions, because English for instance takes up more space than Japanese.

1018,onn-CT7feW8,What Was Hoyoverse Thinking!?... C0 Dehya Showcase & Build Guide (Genshin Impact),"Dehya is finally here... This video covers a massive showcase, optimal Dehya build guide & my thoughts about her.

In this video I cover almost everything you need to know in this Dehya Showcase video - I went through many, MANY different Dehya weapons and artifacts, tested about 9 different Dehya builds, checked how good is Dehya DPS and ultimately - I want to present you this video as one stop solution to decide if Dehya is worth it.

In addition to this, I've tested about 6 different best Dehya teams, examined what Dehya skills can do and even dug deep into how much investment Dehya needs. You'll also see things like popular Dehya + Melt Ganyu team showcased, popular variation of Mono Pyro Dehya, Dehya Burgeon damage going really well using Bloodtainted Greatsword weapon and MORE.

Angry Birds is now completely and utterly irrelevant. If you could travel back in time and tell this fact to somebody in the early 2010s, they simply wouldn’t have believed you. That’s because a decade ago, Angry Birds was more than just the #1 mobile-game series of all time. Angry Birds was a true media empire with games, toys, movies and more. But Now? The name “Angry Birds” is nothing but a distant memory. The brand has rapidly faded into irrelevance, and is now a forgotten relic of the Internet’s past.

At this point, the only hope for the company is in relying on the nostalgia factor of the joy we all felt a decade ago playing such a unique title.

The end is here...

As you can see, I upload strictly Rust content. Since I started playing in 2016 it's been my favorite game. Over those years of enjoying Rust and the one of a kind content it has to offer, I've slowly been evolving my craft as a self-taught editor. I've edited every single one of my main channel videos and I intend to do so for the foreseeable future. So if my schedule seems a little inconsistent, just know I put so much love into every second, and that my process takes time. Thank you so much for watching and making my dream a reality!

Every major innovation and industry leading feature also came with it's own devastating effects on the gameplay and even after 20 years of back and forth game design, we have yet to see the formula reach it's potential.

In this video we'll be looking into every game in the franchise, the good, the bad, the surprises and the mistakes and how it evolved over time as the vision for what Far Cry should be changed.

He started out uploading beats on his YouTube channel in 2013, reaching a large audience all around the world. In 2017, Chuki decided to start a second YouTube channel (Chuki Beats II) where he made tutorials for other producers and slowly transitioned into showcasing his life as a producer and artist.

Moving to Brussels in 2019, he began working with the likes of Krisy, Zwangere Guy, Frenetik and Geeeko, he became one of the main driving forces of the Brussels scene. This resulted in Chuki releasing his first project in 2021 called 'INSIDEOUT'. A really well received project with a beautiful atmosphere, vibe and rollout, featuring many of Chuki's friends and colleagues. 

2022 is all about music for Chuki, as he's getting ready to release his new beat tape called 'Cozy Tapes' while also working on his debut album...

Welcome back to another episode of trader steve's journey across gilenor. In the last episode he unlocked the guardians of the rift minigame. Today we are going to be slowly grinding away at oldschool runescape's most powerful skilling outfit.

Not only will I be working on the runecrafting outfit, but I will also be unlocking multiple new chunks which will increase my runecrafting profits further!

Items to Collect List
https://imgur.com/a/aL2Jfk5

Rules:

-This is a main account that has access to the grand exchange.
-Money can be earned in any way, but no trading or transferring money over to Steve.
-Once a unique rare item from the list has been purchased a new adjacent chunk can be chosen. (I will allow an exceptions to use natural forms of transport such as ships, boats, canoes, minecarts etc
-To unlock new chunks each new item must be unique and not a repeat.

Lyrics:
Dale  miénteme 
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  bebé 
Y  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Por  fa  miénteme
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo
Ay  dime  que  esta  noche  yo  soy  tu  bebé
Y  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Ay  ¿Quién  dijo  amigos? 
Si  te  conozco  mucho  más  sin  la  ropita 
Sé  que  tenés  ganitas  de  estar  conmigo 
Aunque  cuando  hay  gente  me  decís  amiguita 
Sé  que  tú  necesitas

Si  las  miradas  mataran  (tan  tan  tan) 
Tú  y  yo no estaríamos  vivos  papi  (na  na  na) 
Cuando  estamos  acompañados  solo  bla  bla  bla 
Pero  si  estamos  solitos  mucho  mua  mua  mua  (x2) 
(TINI  TINI  TINI)

Dale  miénteme haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  bebé 
Aunque  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos 
Por  fa  miénteme haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Ay  dime  que  esta  noche  yo  soy  tu  bebé 
Y  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Estoy  más  clara  que  el  agua 
Baby  fluyo  aunque  mañana  te  vayas 
Yo  no sé qué me pasa Pero  hoy  quiero  pasarme  de  la  raya

Porque  si  me  besas Las  ganas  se  me  suben  a  la  cabeza 
Hoy  mezclamos  el  tequila  con  cerveza 
Porque  yo  sé  que  en  el  fondo  a  ti  te  gusta 
Dale  confiesa

Porque  si  me  besas 
Las  ganas  se  me  suben  a  la  cabeza 
Hoy  mezclamos  el  tequila  con  cerveza 
Porque  yo  sé  que  en  el  fondo  a  ti  te  gusta 
Solo  confiesa

Dale  miénteme 
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  lady 
Aunque  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Dale  miénteme 
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  bebé

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby

I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails, cherry red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
Ooh, I didn't wanna wanna leave you, baby

LETRA:

Recuerdo que contigo fue tan diferente,
tan natural
Jugando, me decías que leías mi mente
y era verdad

Aún guardo cada carta que me diste
y aunque hay palabras que nunca dijiste
El tiempo que tuvimos no fue
suficiente para olvidar, no

Aunque yo sé que es tarde
para recordar

Una noche rota
Fue la última vez que te perdí
Una vida loca
Cuando sin querеr me despedí

Y hoy quе tú ya no estás,
tú ya no estás
Tú ya no estás aquí

Se quedó en mi boca
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid

Parecen solo días y va casi un año, y aunque lloré
Yo sé que estamos bien, pero a veces te extraño
Yo te adoré

Yo te adoré con locura
y aunque el tiempo todo lo cura
Hay amores que se olvidan,
y hay que amores que siempre duran

Esto no fue una aventura,
pero tuvo que terminar

Aunque yo sé que es tarde
para recordar

Una noche rota
Fue la última vez que te perdí
Una vida loca
Cuando sin querеr me despedí

Y hoy quе tú ya no estás,
tú ya no estás
Tú ya no estás aquí

Se quedó en mi boca
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid

Sé que hubo un beso en Madrid
Un beso en Madrid 
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid, no

Un beso en Madrid
Hoy quedan en mí
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid",2020-10-31 23:57:44+00:00,20429.914543163333,0,Silvia Zc,UCqbdzysdltRoVFskIf_j7-g,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ircObGRWl9A/default.jpg,120,90,144,hd,False,1394774,13418.0,0,143.0,"Si te dedicas a la música y quieres publicidad en mi canal escríbeme por instagram: https://www.instagram.com/silvia.Zc_/

(Letra/Lyrics): 
[Intro: Yandel & Feid]
Déjate ver, dime si hoy vas pa' la calle, bebé
'Toy en el case pensándote otra vez
Quiero pichear, pero me salió al revés
Mi amor, a las dos paso por ti, ve arreglándote
Hoy to' corre por la mía, relájate
Prometí que no iba a hacerte daño
Así me sienta' extraño, soy el que se quedó en tu piel
[Pre-Coro: Feid]
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo quе nunca me cuentas (Me cuеntas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Coro: Yandel & Feid]
Dale hasta abajo que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
E-E-El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Verso 1: Yandel]
Tú ya-Tú ya sabe' lo que quiero, baby, fluya
A ti mucha' te envidian, pero tú estás en la tuya
Mamá, un baile privado pa'l que no sepa na'
Y ya bajamo' tensión
Vine a buscarte, tú sabes la intención
Perreamo' esta canción
Después me dice', ma, que te pareció
Y yo no sé, pero me dio contigo
Estaba ruteando, pensándote y salí del caserío
Quiero probarte, que sea esta noche
Bebé, me traje la corta por si me meto en un lío

[Coro: Feid]
Dale hasta abajo que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
E-E-El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Verso 2: Feid]
'Toy en el punto, bebé, pero estoy pendiente de ti
Los peine' están full, la moto full de gasoli
Gafitas Oakley, machea con la white tee
Me dice ""FERXXO"", qué rico se lo metí
Esa noche 'e jangueo, de fumeteo
Contigo to' los partie' son de perreo
Bebé, cuando te veo, yo te leo
Tú te pierde', mami, yo te rastreo, oh
Baby, me la paso joseando, no tengo de otra
Hagamo' que esta noche sea larga, bebé, porque la vida e' muy corta

[Coro: Yandel & Feid]
Dale hasta abajo, que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)

1131,eK2cuu59WLk,Alyse Maree - Light as a Feather (Miscarriage song),"'Light as a Feather’ composed and sung by Alyse Maree.

This song is for every parent that has lost their baby & to my angel who had a big brother and eager parents already loving you so much! For 11 weeks we got to dream of a future with you. It was a routine doctor visit to check up on our baby’s growth that would change my whole world in an instant. 

If this song brought some comfort or resonated with you, please feel free to share with your other girlfriends who may have gone through this and really try to stick together wherever we can. I really wanted to help shine an important and necessary light on pregnancy loss.

Also (if interested) please subscribe to my channel where I will be uploading more content soon! Stay strong! You’ve got this, even if you think you don’t. You will!

My Personal Experience in Miscarriage and this song:

As someone who has endured and felt the heartbreak of miscarriage, I have written this song to promote awareness of the women, parents and families who go through miscarriage, stillbirth or other loss of pregnancy. 

When I fell pregnant with my second baby naturally, I was overjoyed as I’ve had previous fertility challenges (Endometriosis stage 4 and PCOS) my first born Maxy was an IVF baby! 

I had what’s called a missed miscarriage and for me it meant finding out at 11 weeks that the baby I had been carrying’s heart stopped beating at 8 weeks. I really struggled with this and I remember searching YouTube for a song to help me through these times, but there was no song that I personally could resonate with! When it all felt too much and I couldn’t sleep I went to my piano, sat there in the dark and started writing again. So, here is the result of that night. My own song that would help me through.

I believe women should be able to celebrate their pregnancies for the time they are pregnant and to grieve with the same people who loved hearing the news! Often women don’t tell anyone for the first 12 weeks and in turn have no support if that baby is unfortunately lost. I feel if we can openly talk about falling pregnant, being pregnant and any loss then we can be supported by each other from start to end.

The song will be officially launched on all music platforms (iTunes, Spotify, Amazon etc.) on 15 October – International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day.

1133,93yJTL-260w,As It Was - Harry Styles,"🎶Lyrics:
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

🎤 Lyrics: Paloma Faith - Only Love Can Hurt Like This

[Verse 1]
I tell myself you don't mean a thing
And what we got got no hold on me
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die 'till I feel your touch

[Chorus]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

[Verse 2]
Say I wouldn't care if you walked away
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay
When you come close I just tremble
And every time, every time you go
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

[Chorus]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this
[Bridge]
But it's the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture, makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this

[Chorus]
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt like this)
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt)
Save me, save me
Only love, only love
'Cause only love can hurt like this
And must've been a deadly kiss

Tim Henson has undoubtedly become one of the world's most distinct guitarists and has been appraised by numerous media outlets as well as Steve Vai. How did Polyphia grow to get where they are? How did Tim Henson along with Polyphia become THE biggest name in modern guitar and instrumental music. As the faces of Ibanez guitars, Polyphia has a unique image and are sitting on a throne that will not be taken from them anytime soon.

Like a lot. I even love thru hiking. And backpacking. I love it approximately 69% more than the average American, according to a 2018 Harvard study.

When I was 16, I learned what the Appalachian Trail was. Being an ambitious teenager, I decided that one day I was going to attempt the trek from Georgia to Maine. I realized that goal in 2018, and completed numerous smaller hikes in the years leading up to my AT hike. 

Follow along as I post hiking vlogs, trip reports, and all things related to thru hiking and backpacking. Just don't take me too seriously, or I will call the cops.

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.

Like ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server.

Either I couldn't get my hands on the puppy on time or it they just weren't the right fit for Honey. I knew my honey needed a little sister to play with and I knew I was ready for one more. Unexpectedly my friends came across this baby and brought it to my attention. I fell involve with her and knew she would be perfect.

""Dance Moms"" follows Abby Lee Miller and the nation's favorite tween dancers as they take on Hollywood while new auditions, new competitions, and new studios raise the stakes.

The road has not been easy for “Dance Mom’s” star Abby Lee Miller. After completing her prison sentence last year, the famed dance instructor was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. But if anything, Abby has proven she is a fighter and is not ready to hang up the dance shoes. The new season of Dance Moms follows Abby as she rebuilds her dance company while battling the after-effects of cancer that has left her confined to a wheelchair. Abby is ready to get back to her life and do what she loves most…teaching students to dance! With the goal of putting her life, health and dance studio back together, Abby returns to where it all began – the Abby Lee Dance Company in Pittsburgh.",2021-09-19 16:00:39+00:00,12685.865932052222,31,Dance Moms,UCe4TiRe3lU6kGVr9S3_2SCA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSYAm8pyP-k/default.jpg,120,90,638,hd,False,1170294,18856.0,0,535.0,"Dance Moms follows children's early steps on the road to stardom along with their doting mothers all under Abby Lee Miller's discerning eyes. Presenting a powerful cast of characters, the show immerses itself in the highs and lows surrounding dance competition season, delivering a captivating and dramatic look at the cast's intense pursuit of National Dance titles. Centered on the devoted Miller, who runs Abby Lee Dance Company with an iron tap shoe as she instructs her young, talented students while also dealing with impassioned mothers who go to great lengths to help their children's dreams come true, Dance Moms is about what really goes on behind-the-scenes in the fast-growing and controversial sport of competitive dance.",2016-11-23 19:37:39+00:00,2289.42727099544,1016196724,621,1270000

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

We started our YouTube channel on a whim when we decided to take a year off and go travel back in 2016. One year quickly turned into 4, and at the very end of 2019 we stepped foot in our 100th country. If you want a quick summary of that journey you can watch the documentary here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg

Shortly after achieving our 100 country goal, the pandemic hit. With international travel no longer an option, we bought a van and spent two years traveling around the U.S. living in our tiny home on wheels.

At the beginning of 2022, we moved out of the van and back into our suitcases full-time. We're not exactly sure what our next ""goal"" is going to be, but we're currently having fun bouncing around the globe chasing our passions and interesting stories.

1218,sMDonnsUn-0,Was South Park Right About Family Guy Jokes?,"This video essay analyzes South Park's criticism of Family Guy's joke writing and storytelling. In 2006, South Park's Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy was poorly written as the jokes were interchangeable. This deep dive uncovers the truth about both comedy shows writing style and the merits on both sides of the argument.

The thing about this run is that if i want to stay loyal to Ranni, i cannot accept melina and that means no levelups, no horse, no roundtable. So basically a rune level 1 run+Ranni quest.
This was fun but got painful on the last few bosses because i suck at this game, still worth it tho.
I know there was things that i could have done better, but whatever.
Elden ring is such a great game.

It was a car built by a team of dedicated madmen,
Whose blood had long since been replaced by gasoline.
Hillbillies and bush mechanics, 
moonshiners working without oversight on a singular goal: 

Revive the spirit of AMERICA. 

Legends who would go on to become Redneck Rockstars. 

This is the story of rebels,
Of criminals and corporate suits,
Who came together to save America.

And build the Dodge Viper.

Direct Link: http://abc13.com/2524298/

DRIVER SENTENCED: https://abc13.co/2K7eeyg

A high-speed police chase sprinted across the greater Houston area over lunch time, involving a 200MPH stolen Dodge Hellcat with a deputy's flying tackle ending the wild scene in a cow pasture.

Original chase: 10/13/17

It all started around noon when a suspect in a stolen white car led officers in pursuit along I-10. Speeds, at times, topped well over 100 mph. After roughly an hour, the suspect got off the freeway at the Winnie exit.

At about 1 p.m., the suspect pulled over to the side of Highway 73 south of Beaumont, and got out of the car. He took off on foot into a wooded area.

Officers searched for the driver amid the brush before he was spotted, walking casually and talking on his cell phone. A deputy tackled the man and he was taken into custody by helicopter.

Officers with Houston Police Department and at least one other Harris County agency began the pursuit. Texas DPS troopers, Chambers County Sheriff's deputies and the Beaumont Police Department helicopter assisted in the search.

The driver has been identified as Mohmed Ahmed Abu-Shlieba, 25. He was believed to have been armed during the chase. He was in a stolen vehicle, and had active warrants. There's no word on what new charges he may face.

1236,JZ6vFGldyq4,Ted Lasso: 15 Things You Missed,"When it comes to winning, AFC Richmond are relative strangers, but the series is no stranger when it comes to winning big with them taking home multiple Emmys as well as being one of the most popular comedy series around, and currently that big time fruit company’s flagship series. Like the titular hero, the show has been a surprising hit, charming, loveable and deeper than you originally thought. Not only does it do a great job at capturing football culture and respecting the sport, but it also dives into more difficult and sensitive topics, all while being genuinely hilarious with some of the best, colorful characters on TV (he’s here, he’s there, he’s every blanking where, Roy Kent!). 

That’s why we thought we’d take another look at the show at all the things you may not have noticed the first time around. This will include easter eggs, hidden references, pop culture nods, behind the scenes secrets and general facts all of which went into making the show such a success story. We will talk about all of the sneaky references to real life people, all of the hidden movie references or subtle verbal nods, cast members who auditioned for other roles, others who sent embarrassing tapes to get the role, real life inspirations behind AFC Richmond and their players, injuries that happened on set, and how the show got made in the first place. Diamond Dogs on 3 - 1, 2 3 - DIAMOND DOGS!

Premise: Ted Lasso, an American college football coach, is unexpectedly recruited to coach an English Premier League soccer team, AFC Richmond, despite having no experience coaching soccer.

1269,UKqkb4cEy-E,Miquella and Malenia: The Full Story | Elden Ring Lore,"Of all the twins in Elden Ring (which there is a surprisingly high number of), none are more recognizable than the twin Empyreans known as Miquella, the Unalloyed, and Malenia, Blade of Miquella. As the children of Marika and Radagon, they are some the most pivotal and powerful figures in the Lands Between.

But, for many players, figuring out how these siblings fit into the lore and story of Elden Ring can be surprisingly difficult. On top of that, both Miquella and Malenia have loads of cut content that never made it into the final game.

This video aims to go through all the major points of their timeline with a unique approach to the visuals, so I hope that ends up being something you enjoy!

His role is of key importance both for the history of the Lands Between and for our playthrough in the current day.

1,vPib9KwCBGs,Titans: The Final Episodes | Official Trailer | DC,"What’s born in blood will end in bloodshed. The final episodes premiere April 13 only on #HBOMax.

In the mid-season premiere, the Titans - with the exception of Gar - are returned to the place they had vanished, the Temple of Trigon, only to find Sebastian and Mother Mayhem are no longer there. The Titans rush to find them before Sebastian summons Trigon, their pursuit leading them to a mysterious town whose populace is hiding a deep secret. Along the way, the Titans come across a prophecy that may require Kory to make a huge sacrifice to save the world, but Dick's feelings for Kory surface and he refuses to let her die. In the final episodes, the Titans enter into an epic battle to save both Kory and the world. Gar goes on a quest of self-discovery, attempting to find his true purpose and to save his friends. Rachel embraces darker powers while Conner, struggling with his Lex Luthor side, goes his own way to defeat Sebastian. Tim and Bernard’s growing feelings for each other become increasingly difficult to resist, and when Bernard’s life is threatened, Tim finally becomes the hero he has always strived to be.

6,vS3_72Gb-bI,Blue Beetle – Official Trailer,"He’s A Superhero, Whether He Likes It Or Not #BlueBeetle - Only in Theaters August 18

From Warner Bros. Pictures comes the feature film “Blue Beetle,” marking the DC Super Hero’s first time on the big screen. The film, directed by Angel Manuel Soto, stars Xolo Maridueña in the title role as well as his alter ego, Jaime Reyes.
Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero BLUE BEETLE.

Starring alongside Maridueña (“Cobra Kai”) are Adriana Barraza (“Rambo: Last Blood,” “Thor”), Damían Alcázar (“Narcos,” “Narcos: Mexico”), Elpidia Carrillo (“Mayans M.C.,” the “Predator” films), Bruna Marquezine (“Maldivas,” “God Save the King”), Raoul Max Trujillo (the “Sicario” films, “Mayans M.C.”), with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (“Monarch,” “Dead Man Walking”), and George Lopez (the “Rio and “Smurf” franchises). The film also stars Belissa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories,” “Hocus Pocus 2”) and Harvey Guillén (“What We Do in the Shadows”). Soto (“Charm City Kings,” “The Farm”) directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss Bala”), based on characters from DC.

John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.

The director’s creative team behind the scenes includes director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski (“Midsommar,” “Hereditary”), production designer John Billington (“Bad Boys for Life”), editor Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “The Lost City”), Oscar-nominated costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (“Jojo Rabbit,” the “Thor” films), visual effects supervisor Kelvin McIlwain (“The Suicide Squad,” “Aquaman”) and composer Bobby Krlic (“Midsommar,” the “Snowpiercer” series).

An accessible English dub is available for anyone unable to read subtitles; you can turn it on in your device's player settings. It's experimental and using an AI-generated voice, so it's a long way from perfect, and I can't guarantee it'll be available for future videos, or even for this one long-term! But hopefully it's a step in the right direction.

I'm a bit worried that this comes across as an advert. It's not — I reached out to the team at GIKEN, they had no editorial control, and no money changed hands. (Although they did, of course, go through all the paperwork required to let me climb into their giant robot parking garage.) They also asked me to include this: “Eco Cycle and Eco Park are brand names of GIKEN LTD. in Japan”, which seemed a reasonable enough request.

154,_BZIxt07UNU,This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...,"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.

This was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.

Twitter: @Dream
Instagram: @DreamWasTaken
Snapchat: @Dream

In this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  

Live voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.

I truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.

In this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.

This has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.

Whenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.

I am releasing an SMP, the ""United SMP"", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages. Most of these people are people I never would have been able to collaborate with, or make jokes with, or share with my fans, so I am so excited to share our community with the world. There will be more details on my twitter about this, and I will be live streaming the server in the future.

thank you guys for watching and supporting the channel to make stuff like this possible.",2023-04-03 01:33:01+00:00,27.211407647499996,3,Dream,UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BZIxt07UNU/default.jpg,120,90,1518,hd,False,2621190,225478.0,0,16205.0,"Minecraft stuff, yes, my IGN is Dream",2014-02-08 18:20:05+00:00,3341.434473850799,2905886930,116,31500000

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

After years of being completely faceless online, I finally decided to do a face reveal, and after that my life completely changed. MrBeast took me to Antartica, and it was some of the craziest days of my life.

Antarctica is nothing like anywhere else on earth. The sun never sets, the snow is deeper than you can dig, and the wind is hurricane-like at all times. You have to wear special gear to go outside, to avoid frostbite and also snow blindness. It felt like living on a different planet. The Ice Planet.

Antarctica was incredibly cold, and surviving 50 hours in the wilderness was crazy. It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.

Being able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!). I still want to do one in real life as well. Sorry for the lack of uploads!

Fun fact: Antarctica is the biggest desert on earth!

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.18 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and survive 100 floors on a Minecraft death elevator. We challenged a developer to code 100 floors that increase in difficulty, with one goal, kill us! If they kill us before we beat the 100th floor, they win. If we survive 100 floors, we win. 100 floors may feel like 100 days of hardcore in this challenge :)

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.17 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and find ways to die random deaths that are selected after each round. We have five minutes to find out how to die the way that was chosen before we lose. Me and my friend George both get different random deaths, and whoever loses first loses the game.

This is a little different than my normal content. Rather than being about combat or about trapping, this is about racing and about general Minecraft skills. This was super fun, challenging, and pretty funny overall.

This video is a different rendition of my normal challenge videos, where there are THREE hunters trying to stop me from beating Minecraft.

We're so close to 30 million subscribers! Make sure to subscribe :) also congrats to Mr Beast on 100 million!!!

In this challenge, the pot starts at 1 million dollars and it goes down $69 every 1 second. When I beat the game, the money that's left is given away to a RANDOM SUBSCRIBER! So make sure to subscribe! There's a catch though. If I don't beat the game quick enough, the money goes into the negatives, and that's how much I have to pay my 3 friends that are hunting me down!

It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes, I might try and convince someone else to do it! 

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

194,AohpoRSZKxE,my top games/cookies of 2021,"this video was an excuse to bake a ton of cookies and talk about good video games

full list of games and recipes below

FULL LIST OF MY GAMES/COOKIES OF THE YEAR:
5. Monster Hunter Rise
Recipe: https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/snowball-cookies-that-melt-in-your-mouth/
(Just split it into three and add gel food coloring. They are a little crumbly, so maybe don't try to skewer them.)

4. Metroid Dread
Recipe: https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/classic-peanut-butter-blossom-cookies/a3563f6e-96b0-443f-ae0a-53cef4be6db6
(I had to put in 50 drops of purple food coloring and it barely worked. Also, I just squished green M&Ms on the top and used green icing from a supermarket. This is a child's cookie and that's what makes it great.)

3. Death's Door
Recipe: https://tasty.co/recipe/macarons
(I piped a few extra little dots of the macaron batter in order to make the handles for Pothead and attached them with buttercream. I broke up some thin pretzel sticks for his log neck.)

2. Resident Evil Village
Recipe: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10766-biscotti or this one if you don't want to subscribe there: https://www.shelovesbiscotti.com/almond-biscotti/
(I replaced half the almonds with raw pistachios to add a little extra chewiness. I melted chocolate chips in the microwave and then painted them on the bottoms and let them set.)

1. Inscryption
Recipe: It's plain old shortbread. I used this recipe: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018784-shortbread-10-ways
but you could probably use any solid shortbread recipe.
(I piped on black icing to make the cookie. I did not take a photo of a person and transfer their consciousness into the cookie. Stop asking if I did.)

More about The Warhorn (from Steam):

The Warhorn is a medieval RPG mixed with city-building and management elements. Play as an adventurer who decided to leave his dull life as a lumberjack behind to explore a dangerous world full of puzzles in the pursuit of the most valuable relic mankind has ever seen: The Warhorn!

Weary of the life as a lumberjack, you decide to leave the safe walls of your homeland in order to travel far away and begin the life of an adventurer. Months later, just as you start to doubt your decision, you arrive on an archipelago where you hear about something called “The Warhorn”: A relic capable of granting immortality!

You decide to settle on one of the islands – where your story shall begin. 
The Warhorn is a take on the unique mixture of genres, the most important ones being RPG and city-building/management while other distinctive elements in the game come from the exploration, puzzle and open world genres.

Explore a vast open world: Including 5 themed biomes like spring / summer, autumn, winter, desert and jungle having their own unique sub-biomes with their own unique resources and denizens.

Solve challenging puzzles: While most of them can be done alone, some might need a helping hand – or two.

Face various foes: Every biome comes with its own set of animals, beasts and other denizens. Some of them may be neutral, but others could be deadly.

Learn new skills: Wield a sword, swing a hammer or laugh at brute force and master the elements like fire, ice and light. Villagers can teach you many things, but in order for them to share their knowledge, you might have to earn their trust first… or a sizeable amount of riches.

Build your empire: Learn how to build with different materials and create a village to your liking. Villagers will gather resources for you while your villages’ soldiers are protecting your empire.

Be ready for war: Build powerful war machines to either defend your village or attack another in a fight for resources, relics and secrets of this world.
Multiplayer: Everything in the game can be done together. Build the most incredible empire with your friends, trade with other empires or fight against them.

Sent to find a missing billionaire on a remote island, you find yourself in a cannibal-infested hellscape. Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.

A Survival Horror Simulator
Experience complete freedom to tackle the world how you want. You decide what you do, where to go and how best to survive. There are no NPC's barking orders at you or giving you missions you don't want to do. You give the orders, you choose what happens next.

Fight Demons
Enter a world where nowhere is safe and fight against a range of mutated creatures, some who are almost human like, and others who are like nothing you have ever seen before. Armed with pistols, axes, stun batons and more, protect yourself and those you care for.

Build and Craft
Feel every interaction; Break sticks to make fires. Use an axe to cut out windows and floors. Build a small cabin, or a sea-side compound, the choice is yours.

Changing Seasons
Pluck fresh salmon directly from streams in spring and summer. Collect and store meat for the cold winter months. You're not alone on this island, so as winter rolls in and food and resources become scarce you won't be the only one looking for a meal.

Co-op Gameplay
Survive alone, or with friends. Share items and work together to build defenses.

More about Meeple Station (from Steam):

DISCLAIMER: Meeple Station is in active development and is therefore subject to constant change. Nothing is representative of final gameplay. We update as often as possible so during it's Alpha state, There-Will-Be-Bugs. We try our best to smash them as soon as we're aware of them so most bugs are fixed shortly after patch-days. We'd appreciate if you gave the in-game bug report button a nice hard punch and let us know if you encounter any during your play - it helps us quickly get them fixed. We always endeavor greatly to not break saves- because that's annoying, but it's not always avoidable. Thankfully we've only had to do that once so far. So sorry bout that one, but ya' can't win 'em all.
So What Is Meeple Station?

So What Is Meeple Station?

Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee!
Meeple need things to live!

Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire.

Trade!

At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets.
Fight off lazy pirates!

Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers.

We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem.

How to Be the Worst Neighbor In Existence - Junkyard Truck

#LetsGameItOut #Simulation

----------

Check it out on Steam ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/1697880/Junkyard_Truck/

More about Junkyard Truck (from Steam):

Junkyard Truck is an open-world off road driving, mechanic simulator, and job simulator. Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.

If you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash.

- Fully integrated stock engine and drivetrain with over 60 stock parts, a swappable V8 engine with even more parts, and lots of aftermarket parts.
- Upgradeable parts such as EFI conversion, headers, drive gears, turbochargers, several off road tire options, and accessories.
- Fully responsive engine and drivetrain which exhibits true-to-life performance and auditory feedback on part failure, temperature, or fluid issues.
- Miles of off road trails and roadways.
- Open world game with freedom to play how you want to play.
- Off road challenges; some which are difficult, others which are nearly impossible.
- Make money with heavy delivery missions, rescue missions, collecting junk around the map and recycling it at the junkyard. Or work for yourself by brewing moonshine, logging, mining, or pressing your luck at the pub playing Texas Hold'em.
- Day and night cycle, requiring you maintain your food, hydration, and sleep.
- Softbody physics.",2022-09-30 15:00:14+00:00,4453.757796536389,23,Let's Game It Out,UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_8KmRw8610/default.jpg,120,90,1058,hd,False,3776117,156121.0,0,5963.0,"A gaming let's play channel by some guy named Josh who makes fun-loving videos filled with joy and sarcasm.

We live on a water planet. And the currents generated in the oceans affect all of our lives, even if you don't live near the ocean. So as evidence seems to mount that the North Atlantic Gulf Stream is weakening - in fact, it's the weakest it's been in over a thousand years - that's something to pay attention to.

But is it the doomsday scenario many people are predicting? Let's take a look.

It took humans 10,000 years to go from hunter-gatherers to world domination. Considering the vastness of time that humans and life have been on Earth, could this have happened once before?

This question was put forth by Adam Frank and Gavin Schmidt in their paper titled The Silurian Hypothesis, where they tried to figure out what in the geologic record would be a sign of a previous industrial civilization. It brings up a lot of questions and makes you deal with the weight of deep time, as well as the fleeting nature of history.

Venus has long been called Earth's twin, because our sizes are so similar. But as we learned in the early 60s, on our surface we couldn't be more different. This wasn't always the case though. It's thought that up until about 500 million years ago, our planets were very similar, in fact Venus may have supported life. So what happened?

On November 12, 1970, a cyclone hit the country of Bangladesh (which was known as East Pakistan at the time) that through a combination of bad timing, location, miscommunication, and political malice became the deadliest storm in human history, killing more than half a million people in one day. It became known as the Bhola Cyclone, and it set in motion a series of events that led to a genocide, a revolution, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

►Official “Mad Max” Lyrics:

I’m just playing ain’t get in my bag yet  
Married to money no cuffing I’m past that  
On the 4th tryin flock at his dad hat  
Flock off the peddle 
 I’m catching a flash back  
Moving devious feel like I’m mad max  
Pull up get whacked then get dragged where the trash at  
30k or better in the backpack  
30 sticks ladders and we moving mad tact  

Like it ain’t nothing these niggas could do with me 
Bands with the Gucci Amiri and Louis V 
Ain’t no telling  
No you can’t bool with me 
DOA all my Double R’s true to me  
Like niggas broke and I’m not with the foolery 
Catch me a rapper I’m taking his jewelry  
Like Kk my brother I know he gon oot for me  
I’m high off the Rah Like you could meet 
Oh you gonna spot em we got em we drop em  
Like no talking we not with the nonsense  
Like Die Y what’s a goon to a goblin 
Like any problem I bet Ima solve it  
Gotta be ease I can’t love on a bitch  
I got certain reasons I don’t trust me a bitch 
30s Dougz up now they say I’m the shit  
And these niggas be mad that a young Nigga rich  

I’m just playing ain’t get in my bag yet  
Married to money no cuffing I’m past that  
On the 4th tryin flock at his dad hat  
Flock off the peddle 
 I’m catching a flash back  
Moving devious feel like I’m mad max  
Pull up get whacked then get dragged where the trash at  
30k or better in the backpack  
30 sticks ladders and we moving mad tact

►Official “Spinnin” Lyrics:

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

Ayo Sam 
I stay with the cuz 
Make it hot any weather 
I ride for my brothers 
We flocking together  
Pour straight out of the bottle  
Don’t need me a measure 
It’s forty and better when I’m at the teller 
I spot em I boomin at you and whoever 
Whenever, I promise you this shit is feathers  
My flockas I love ‘em I got em forever 
When flocka come home we gon get it together  

I been the aggressor applying the pressure 
I signed it was treasure  
And then it got better 
And then it get better and better and better  
Right under the sweater 
I’m ready whenever 
Ain’t cuffing these bitches  
Ain’t no love for no heifer 
You jackin the fellas  
but ain’t sending no money 
ain’t checking on mommy 
ain’t send em letter  
I said I know Fivio and shorty got wetter 

Niggas know I’ma go  
I’m stomp every step 
They like B-Lovee you different 
He not like the rest 
Come straight from the jects 
Where they put shit to rest  
He gon end up like Yus  
with a whole in his chest 
Put bro on his ass 
Told him shot every step 
Give a fuck what they say 
Bitch I feel like a vet 
I ain’t dodging no smoke  
Bitch I’m one for the wreck 
Put a shot through a coat 
Bet it knock of the dress 

It’s a party but I’m on different 
On my hip glocky or the smith and 
Too much money 
I be shitting 
I'm too sleazy 
nigga I’ma get it  

Let em put him on a stretch  
Tryna play like he cool 
Put a hole in his brain 
Fuck a name  
Now he food 
Opps in the spot  
Get to shaking the room gra 
Now tryna put what’s his name on the news 

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They rolling 

Yeah 
Aye ugh 
I ride spinners  
If you a bad bitch, won't buy ya dinner 
Later on I’m diving in her 
They shooting shit like Kawaii Leonard 
None of my bitches wear make up  
Keep the mac with me no Kylie Jenner 
You gon need some damn cosmetics 
Cuz my young niggas get so aggressive 
That choppa singing like Snoe Allegra  
Man I really need to get my shit together 
I’ve been laying low and I’ve been getting cheddar 
Like that Drake song I want that shit forever 
Aye free the lil nigga Kay Flock 
Been a real nigga since the age five 
Back in high school I saw the trey five  
Yeah I was in the crib listening to based god 
Me and my nigga Dougie B live in luxury 
Come and fuck with me 
My little cousin Ty live in the bronx  
So I don’t ever stay at the Double Tree 
Back in high school i had a’s and b’s 
Now all my hoes got double D’s 
Got another cousin that stay in New York 
And he say this shit is really like the jungle b 
I’m a real nigga can’t humble me  
Can’t quiet me, they admire me 
And lately I’ve been popping mad bars 
Cuz they fame shit give me anxiety 
And all these niggas claim they want smoke
but whole time they practicing sobriety 
But I’m the good guy and that’s the irony 
I’m a fucking menace to society 
Lil bitch  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They rolling

It’s also been updated with new interior tech, the new iDrive system, and features…bold exterior styling. Thomas and James are excited to get behind the wheel of the newest M car on the market.

The 2023 C8 Corvette Z06 ($189,027 in Canada, $164,505 in the US) could be well described as a feat of American engineering, but how does it compete against the pinnacle of all-wheel drive speed from Japan? Today it’s up against a Nissan GT-R Nismo ($291,998 in Canada, $210,740 in the US) and a violently modified R34 GT-R that pushes over 1000 horsepower. Will the mid-engine layout and roaring American flat-plane crank V8 be enough to overcome the legendary Nissan turbo 6? Thomas is in the Corvette, James is in the GT-R Nismo, and our friend @OriginalAuto is piloting their R34. Get ready for some loud noises. Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race! Especially when a tuned GTR is in the mix…Watch to see what happens! SUBSCRIBE! 

A huge thank you to @OriginalAuto for bringing out and piloting their R34

But how does it compare in a drag race against the special-edition newcomer, the Toyota GR Corolla Morizo Edition ($59,990 in Canada, $49,990 in the US)? The front-wheel drive Civic Type R has more power and more torque, but the weight-reducing Morizo Edition makes the GR slightly lighter despite its all-wheel drive traction advantage. 

What happens when these two hot hatches line up at Willow Springs for a drag and a roll race? Will the Civic’s power advantage be enough to overcome the weight and traction advantage of the Corolla? Thomas is in the Honda and James is in the Toyota - let’s see what happens. Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race! Thanks for watching. SUBSCRIBE!

In this Competition spec, the Audi RS5 comes equipped with all sorts of goodies to help improve both presence and performance. The package ups the top speed of the car to 290 km/h (180 mph), it adds 3-way adjustable coil overs and stiffer sway bars, and includes a smattering of comfort and stylish add-ons, such as a new exhaust system and alcantara trim bits. 

But can this fast and stylish Audi do more than impress with its looks and speed? How does it drive when pushed towards the limit? And have the suspension upgrades helped deal with the RS5’s tendency to understeer? Thomas and James dive into the RS5 Competition to find out what it’s all about. We hope you enjoy the episode!

The Elantra N has the on-paper advantage, since it has more horsepower and access to launch control. But as we’ve found out time and time again - don’t underestimate a 2.0 L Turbo Accord. Will the tried and true Honda be able to take down the more powerful Hyundai? Or will the Elantra N’s power and launch control advantage prove to be too much for mighty Accord Sport?

Before making their switch to mid-engine for the C8, Chevy decided to throw everything at their last beastly C7. It can reach a top speed of 341 kph (212 mph) thanks to its 6.2 L supercharged V8, which stands so tall it needs a shaker hood just so it can fit.

312,62Wf3GMJzpQ,Ferrari F8 Tributo Review // Hold Me Closer,"The 2022 Ferrari F8 Tributo (~$447,920 CAD converted, $358,783 USD as specced) may just be the last Ferrari of its kind. Ferrari is progressing towards smaller displacement, hybrid engines. The F8 Tributo however, still proudly displays its 3.9L mid-engine V8 beneath an F40 inspired Lexan cover. Assisted by twin-turbos that have been designed to reduce turbo lag, a mighty 710 horsepower and 568 lb feet of torque are easily accessible by the driver. But how is it to drive on a canyon road? And how does it compare to Ferraris of the past, such as the legendary 458? Thomas and James are excited to see what the F8 Tributo is all about. We hope you enjoy the episode! SUBSCRIBE!

Other than that, I had a great week last week: McLaren shoot, Dodgers returned to full capacity at home, Buster brought me a cake, and then we hit the hot tub before my first night of a new sleep study I'm doing.

In this video, we give you guys a tour of the $25,000 a night penthouse suite we got to stay in for our Bachelor/Bachelorette party in Vegas, back in October. It was ~pretty insane~, with 14,000 square feet of horses, pools, pianos, and bidets. What do you guys think of this 3 bed, 3 bath (plus jacuzzi) hotel room??

This video is NOT sponsored, but we did get to stay at the Westgate for free. You can check out the Westgate here, if you're interested! (they do have other rooms that are not this pricey!)

This week we’re gonna be trying out a recipe (or dare I say, ""hack"") that Gordon Ramsay has gone absolutely ballistic over on his TikTok: a T-Bone steak slathered in peanut butter. We’re here to find out if it really is as awful as Gordon seems to think it is or if this recipe will pleasantly surprise us!

Yes, we know this is not how you're supposed to cook an actual steak, and yes, we know that the peanut butter jar we used is already contaminated even though we didn't spoon the stuff from the pan back in the jar! We had to retire the jar after this video.

Lyrics (Spanish)
Se pinta los Labios
Hoy no tiene horario
Quiere que la busque en el lambo

Esta noche coronamos
Dale
Parate terminar lo que empezamos

Baila morena
Baila morena

Baila morena
Baila morena

Baila morena 
Baila morena

Una nena asi me hacia falta
Que metiera mi mano por su falda
Se ve que no es santa
Es como yo que le gusta la maldad

Dale baby no seas mala
No pares de moverte que eso me encanta
Babysita dame una, 
una probaita 
Tu eres una mamacita

Cuando chingamos baby tu nunca te quitas
Mueve to ese b0oty tan chulita como anita
Tu estas dura

Dame tequila no quiero vaina
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua
Quiero “maninanini yaya”
Traime tequila no quiero baina 
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua

Ponte freaky, freakytona 
Tu eres una chapa chapeadora
Ella es bellaquisima pero no se enamora
Mi chingamos hay que darte un diploma
Ninguna se te iguala 
Ella me dice vente papi me la saca 
Ella Es mala flow shakira waka waka
Ella tiene el culo bello pero es flaca 
La baby flaca 

Quiero manina nini yaya
Dame tequila no quiero vaina
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua

La baby esta borracha 
Rakata x8
Mami 
ta x25

Quiero manina nini yaya
Dame tequila no quiero vaina
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua

Hi Everyone 👋   We're Eamon and Bec. In 2017 we bought our first sprinter van and spent 30 days renovating it into our dream tiny home. The plan was to van life around the world and we'd made it all the way from Canada to Africa. Fast forward to COVID...us abandoning our van in a Moroccan parking lot, flying home to Canada, converting yet another van, and then moving to our cabin in the woods. We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international van life travels. Our return to van life is in the near future but before we fly to Morocco we wanted to have a little fun with Kara & Nate.

The first time we abandoned this van was in March of 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. We returned at the end of 2021 to find our tiny home parked exactly as we’d left it (much to our surprise!). We began our victory lap through Morocco and flew home for what we thought would be a quick breast surgery… turns out I had stage 3 breast cancer.

466,-fEGC5gTQ18,WHAT HAS HE DONE!? Tavarish Bought the INFAMOUS Flood Damage McLaren P1,"There's crazy, and then there's what @tavarish has gone and done! Freddy has bought the infamous flood damaged McLaren P1, and my goodness does he have his work cut out to bring this back to the road. Let's head over in his re-built 675LT to go check it out... Oh boy!

I first visited Freddy when he had just bought the crash damaged 675LT, and in fact it had certainly seen better days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9kf5t5PWDA However, fast forward and it's had a total overhaul, been brough back to life, and has numerous totally unique features.

Observant viewers will notice that unfortunately this 675LT has since rather blown up... to put it lightly. Hopefully it's easy enough to work out that this was filmed beforehand and held back to reveal the P1 once Freddy had taken the wraps off to the world! More about all of that on @tavarish's channel.

However, today is all about the P1, the most infamous P1 in the world. The car that was destroyed by the hurricane in Florida last September, seem by millions in videos and images being battered around the owner's garage in flood water, sailing off down the street, and coming to a rest atop a toilet. Of course that was a devastating event and sadly many lost lives in the brutal weather, however it's Freddy's goal to get this car back on the road one day.

When it comes to a rebuild project, it's safe to say that this must be the biggest undertaking ever seen in this space. Not only has the car been entirely submerged, but every body panel has taken a battering, and absolutely nothing works as it should. I have no idea how he's going to manage, but I can't wait to see it finished!

A huge congratulations to Freddy on this massive brave pill he's swallowed, it's going to be quite the ride:

468,iG-rJF2rq5U,"Meet HapyHipi, the MOST ECCENTRIC Collector in the World!","HapyHipi's garage and collection is the most eccentric you will ever see! Join me with Tim for a special visit to discover the eclectic cars, through to the most incredible private toy rooms in the world, and the brand new building in construction. This private garage is like no other!

I have honestly never visited anywhere quite like the fabulous purpose built buildings found here; from the cars that are contained within to everything else that joins them. The cars themselves include a red carbon Bugatti Chiron that's been driven at 261mph, to a matching pair of green carbon McLarens with the P1 and Senna. The collection extends to featuring numerous modified supercars, muscle cars, classic American cars and plenty more as we head through the various locations.

Tim very kindly takes us on a full tour of the original building, through to the new HapyHipi Town that is under construction, which honestly will take your breath away. Along the way we can discover the collections of gas pumps, signs, Hot Wheels, model cars, and anything you can think of. Wherever you look there's something new to take in and to appreciate, whether it's the Coca-Cola memorabilia, or the set of figures of Evel Knievel.

Words cannot really explain this experience. Tim's completely unique style is unleashed with no holds barred throughout, from the colours and style, to the ideas and creations he comes up with. This is the result of a man who is not afraid to challenge the norms and follow his imagination, and that is just immense to see. I cannot thank Tim and his wife enough for hosting our visit to their fabulous location, and the time taken to share this with you.

469,gC1XpCAuTDQ,"Meet VINWIKI's ED BOLIAN, and His Lamborghini Murcielago SV UNLEASHED!","We join Ed Bolian, the founder of @VINwiki, to talk all things Lamborghini Murcielago with a full garage update, and drive in his LP670 SV! After checking out the trio of Murcis, Spkyer and Lusso, we've got to get the $1m+ bull out onto the road, let's go!

We'll start our tour by admiring Ed's two gated manual Lamborghini Murcielagos. These are truly works of automotive art, two of the rarest version of Murcielagos out there in their respective forms. Next, we'll check out Ed's Ferrari GTC4Lusso and Spyker C8, two more examples of the incredible craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into creating a truly world-class supercar. Whether you're a fan of Italian or Dutch engineering, there's no denying the beauty and performance of these machines.

But the highlight of our tour is yet to come. we've chosen Ed's Lamborghini Murcielago SV for us to take for a spin, to experience the full rawness of this limited edition supercar. With Ed at the wheel, let's learn a little more about the Murcielago and in particular the information that he's learned about the car thanks to a network of enthusiasts. Then it's my turn to get behind the wheel and be reminded how little sense the Murci really makes, but yet how perfect it is anyway!

So join along as we explore Ed Bolian's supercar garage and experience the thrill of driving his Lamborghini Murcielago SV. It's always a pleasure to catch up with Ed in Atlanta, so be sure to also check out my latest stories on the @VINwiki channel too!

470,CBAbD9PD24g,COMPLETE TOUR of My Car Collection! 2023; 13 Years of YouTube,"Welcome to a full walk through of my entire car collection! We'll run through everything; hypercars, supercars, project cars, showcars, hot hatches and everything in between, with all of the details about age, mileage and maintenance costs as we go.

The Shmeemobiles as they are known, have been showcased over the years through the content on both the @Shmee150 and @TheShmuseum channels, but never before have I done a complete walkaround of all the cars in detail, with their stories, unique details, and maintenance costs. It's rare to have quite such a high percentage of the collection all together at the same time, so it's the perfect opportunity to dive into some of the details and stories that went into each particular car.

Inspired by @AdamLZ and @TheStradman's overviews of their collections, hopefully this can act as a resource with sections on each of the cars; why they are in the colours they are, and all the modifications and changes that have gone into each one of them. With a broad variety of manufacturers present in the line-up, and the cars stacked up on the BendPak Autostackers, there's a lot to go through!

I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey, especially those who have been here from the earlier years and even beyond the eldest of the cars in the garage. This has been quite the journey since the first Shmee150 video almost exactly 13 years ago, and there has been more than a video a day since then on average.

Thanks for watching, Tim

471,JDVLWPnKJj8,My DREAM FIRST DRIVE in the New LAMBORGHINI COUNTACH!,"I can't believe this day from my dreams! Join me for my first drive with the new Lamborghini Countach LPI800-4; the latest few-off series hypercar. I'm at the Lamborghini factory for a full experience of what the car is all about, heading up into the Italian mountains. Let's go!

Limited to only 112 customer cars, linking to the LP112 codename of the original Countach, this particular example is car 0, that Lamborghini have very kindly taken out from the Museum for this opportunity to share with you what it's all about. Following on the heels of the Reventon, Veneno, Centenario and Sian, it's the latest road going model from the series that also includes the track-only Sesto Elemento.

Powered by a 6.5l NA V12 with Lamborghini's Supercapacitor system that was introduced with the Sian and Sian Roadster, the Countach offers up 814hp and a top speed in excess of 355km/h (221mph). However, this is a car that tells an emotional story, 50 years after the first concept Countach was launched back in 1972; a model that lasted 16 years in production and set a very high bar for iconic supercars.

Visually, the new Countach features design elements from the likes of the P400/P500, Periscopio, 5000 Quattrovalvole, and 25th Anniversary editions of the original, while being based on the platform of the Aventador, which itself is soon to be superceded by a long-awaited new model. In many ways it's the last of an era, the last special vehicle on this platform, and one that brings a glorious heritage no with it.

This particular car is finished in Bianco Siderale over a red heritage interior; inspired by the spec of the very Countach owned by Ferruccio Lamborghini himself at the time. After taking a full walkaround to go through the specification and understand the details of the car, it's time to head into the hills to find some stunning scenery with the hills blanketed in a layer of snow. This is absolutely a day from my dreams; the car, location, experience, thank you to Lamborghini!

Thanks for watching, Tim

Polar Peak is one of the new named locations introduced in season 7 of Fortnite Battle Royale. This location started out as cold as ice, but soon things started to heat up with the winter iteration of the zombies returning. That's right, these drops take place mostly during the ice storm event, also known as snowy Fortnitemares. Watch as I conquer the melting Polar Peak and take on the frosty zombies.

The film also stars Belissa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories,” “Hocus Pocus 2”) and Harvey Guillén (“What We Do in the Shadows”). Soto (“Charm City Kings,” “The Farm”) directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss Bala”), based on characters from DC.

John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.

The director’s creative team behind the scenes includes director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski (“Midsommar,” “Hereditary”), production designer John Billington (“Bad Boys for Life”), editor Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “The Lost City”), Oscar-nominated costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (“Jojo Rabbit,” the “Thor” films), visual effects supervisor Kelvin McIlwain (“The Suicide Squad,” “Aquaman”) and composer Bobby Krlic (“Midsommar,” the “Snowpiercer” series).

577,0OGN0ZBzNWM,Blue Beetle Origin - Sentient Alien Scarab Latches A Body To Create DC's Most Interesting Superhero,"You know, in a world filled with super-powered gorillas, rage-fueled cosmic cats, and a flying dog whose name probably inspired the digital currency of the “metaverse”, a magical, ancient scarab actually sounds rather commonplace. But this is a comic book character we’re talking about, so it would be surprising if Blue Beetle didn’t have a convoluted backstory. The character actually originated in 1939, as the featured superhero of Fox’s short-lived comic book publication house. Debuting in The Mystery Men issue #1, Dan Garret was a regular cop by day and the masked, investigative vigilante known as Blue Beetle by night. In other words, he was basically Fox’s version of Batman, except he wasn’t all that rich and his increased strength & agility came from a secret formula called Vitamin 2X. Over time, the Blue Beetle evolved into a more traditional Golden Age superhero and was given his own series. But Fox soon went out of business, and then Charlton Comics- who had obtained the rights to Blue Beetle- sold its entire gallery of supers to DC Comics in 1983, which is how the character ended up traveling from “Earth 4” to the main DC continuity during “Crises on Infinite Earths”. Since then, he’s become one of its most-influential characters, becoming possibly the best DC superhero outside of the Justice League. But what is Blue Beetle all about? And how did he go from literal obscurity to becoming an inspiration for Alan Moore’s Watchmen? This video will answer all that, and more; this is Blue Beetle’s Origins – Explored.

Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that
home is not quite as he left it. As he searches to find his purpose in the world, fate intervenes when Jaime unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero BLUE BEETLE.

The film also stars Belissa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories,” “Hocus Pocus 2”) and Harvey Guillén (“What We Do in the Shadows”). Soto (“Charm City Kings,” “The Farm”) directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss
Bala”), based on characters from DC. John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers. The director’s creative team behind the scenes includes director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski (“Midsommar,” “Hereditary”), production designer John Billington (“Bad Boys for Life”), editor
Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “The Lost City”), Oscar-nominated costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (“Jojo Rabbit,” the “Thor” films), visual effects supervisor Kelvin McIlwain (“The Suicide Squad,” “Aquaman”) and composer Bobby Krlic (“Midsommar,” the “Snowpiercer” series).

An enormous thanks to Prof. Steven Strogatz — this video would not have been possible without him. Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to. His Podcast ""The Joy of X"" is wonderful — please listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-x

Apparently religion is on the decline in the United States

However, it’s still very difficult for a political candidate today to get elected if they are not religious. In fact, candidates often hype up how religious they are by making sure media outlets know when they are going to church. See! Look at me! I’m going to church! I’m a good boy!

The current U.S. President, Joe Biden, identifies as a Roman Catholic, making him only the second American President in history to be Catholic.

Article 6, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution says you can’t be forced to take a religious test in order to hold a government position, but obviously, voters can be biased against or for candidates based on their religion. 

In this video, I’m going to briefly look at the religion of every President in American history, and some of them might just surprise you.

Canada and The United States of America

The two biggest countries in North America

Both have a lot in common... 

Woah, are we really gonna do this? Ok, let’s do this…

Both have very close cultural and economic ties. 

So actually, both are two of the biggest countries in the world. Canada is slightly bigger than the United States. 

Both share the world’s longest border between two countries. The border stretches 5,525 miles….or...I mean, 8,891 kilometers. Yeah while Canada has officially adopted the metric system as a whole, the United States is only one of three countries in the entire world that hasn’t. That said, plenty of Canadians don’t always use the metric system to measure stuff, and plenty of Americans do often use the metric system.

Anyway, let’s stick with more similarities first, ok?

Both are two of the wealthiest, most developed countries in the world. Immigrants have flocked to both countries for economic opportunity for centuries, which is why major cities in both are some of the mostly ethnically diverse in the world. 

Both have mixed economies and have a progressive tax system on income. However, Canadians definitely pay higher taxes overall.

Oh lots of trading be going on between the two. The United States is Canada’s largest trading partner, and Canada is consistently a top three trading partner for the United States. Both are in NATO and have historically fought as allies in wars.

Both have lots of natural resources. Both have a wide variety of climates and rainfall patterns.

Both are democratic. Specifically, the United States is a democratic republic, and Canada is a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. 

Both are growing at about the same rate. (C- .7%, US- .8%)

Residents of both generally like their space. Indeed, everything is more spread out in both countries.",2020-12-11 15:59:56+00:00,20244.76279653639,18,Mr. Beat,UCmYesELO6axBrCuSpf7S9DQ,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUz_0DM7F48/default.jpg,120,90,1363,hd,True,2040061,35135.0,0,9134.0,"For all sponsorship inquiries, please contact me at mrbeat@algebramedia.com

CORRECTIONS
- Now I regret mentioning the Danube river! Apart from that one aside about international diplomacy and a port: for the rest of the networks I did not include rivers, even if they are navigable to an ocean. I appreciate these would change things like London and apparently the USA has some super great lakes.
- Let me know if you spot anything else!

In just a few short years, Japan’s Superconducting Maglev (SCMaglev) will become the world’s fastest train in operation. Traveling at near aircraft-like speeds of 503km per hour, the SCMaglev will eventually link Japan’s population centers of Tokyo and Osaka in just 67 Minutes.
 
The SCMaglev will operate on the Chuo Shinkansen, a new 438km intercity route connecting Tokyo to Osaka. The line will run right through a mountain range, requiring the vast majority of the route to run in tunnels. However, the Chuo Shinkansen will be more direct than the current Shinkansen high-speed rail route. The first section is expected to open in 2027 with the remaining connection to Osaka completed a decade later in 2037

The SCMaglev will be the world’s first superconducting maglev to enter service. To levitate trains off their guideway, electromagnets are cooled to extreme temperatures in order to take advantage of a phenomenon called superconductivity. The electromagnets on board the train interact with two sets of coils embedded inside a guideway, one to propel the train and the other levitation and guidance. The low electrical resistance in superconducting magnets allows SCMaglevs to consume 30% less energy than other high-speed maglev trains, like Germany’s Transrapid.
  
The technology behind SCMaglev is nearly 60 years in the making. But the Chuo Shinkansen is also one of the most expensive transport projects in history and an enormous bet on high-speed maglev, a technology that has yet to prove itself. Given the enormous costs and move away from proven high-speed rail technologies, some question whether building the world's fastest train really makes sense.

Listen / by Beyonce
和訳: ジェフ

Listen to the song here in my heart
(聞いて 心からの歌)
a melody I start but can't complete
(まだ終われない歌声を)
Listen to the sound from deep within
(聞いて 始まりの音)
Its only beginning to find release
(心は出口を探してる)
Ohh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
(夢を語るときがきた)
They will not be pushed aside and turned　
(誰にも押されず)
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
(あなたの心で 聞いて)

Listen I am alone at a crossroads, I'm not at home 
(聞いて 家を出て 独りここに立ち)
in my own home
(変わらず)
And I've tried and tried　To say whats on my mind
(気持ちを言葉にしている)
You should have known
(そこにも届くかな)

Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
(いまは信じてほしい 感じるんだ)
I'm more than what　You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me

He put together a great all-around performance in this series to cap off one of the best postseason runs of his career at just 22 years old. The Lakers also punctuated one of the most dominant Playoff runs in NBA history, finishing with a postseason record of 15-1. This was the highest Playoff winning percentage for a championship-winning team in the history of the league up to that point, remaining the best until the 2017 Warriors went 16-1.

2009 Western Conference Finals Game 3, May 23, 2009 | One of my favorite playoff performances by Kobe. There was uncertainty with the Lakers after they lost game 2 at home to go to Denver, one of the toughest places to play for opposing teams, in a tied series. Kobe had that look all night long and you knew he was all business from the opening jump. He poured in 41 points, none bigger than his dagger three over JR Smith to put the Lakers up 1 with just over a minute remaining. The Lakers wouldn't look back after that three, ending the game on a 10-2 run to win the game and take back the series lead at 2-1.

''On tonight's 'ACM Girls Night Out' CBS special, Ronnie Dunn serenaded Sugarland singer Jennifer Nettles with one of her own songs, the 2007 platinum hit, 'Stay.'

""Jennifer, my love,"" Dunn said as he took the microphone. ""You've been an incredible friend to me, and it's an honor to sing this song tonight. I hope I can do it justice.""

Nettles was invited to the event to be honored as one of only two female artists in the academy's history to ever write and perform the winning Song of the Year for 'Stay,' an achievement that she alone can take credit for. She sat perched in her throne at the side of the stage and watched as her country music peer, formerly of Brooks and Dunn, poured out the same emotion that she put into the song originally.

Though, Dunn's unique male touch gave an entirely new element to the song, and the 'Bleed Red' soloist received applause from both the audience and Nettles as he drew the last note.

""Thank you so much, that was really, really beautiful,"" Nettles said to Dunn, still in awe. ""It's wonderful to be included in such beautiful -- and talented -- company. That was great.""

Tonight's event honored female artists the Judds, Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Loretta Lynn and Carrie Underwood -- as well as Nettles -- for their great achievements  in the industry.''

Tom Nardone is an example of pursuing the American Dream of financial freedom. At age 19, he started working for the Post Office as a mailman. It didn’t take him long to realize that the security entrapment of “good job” is not a lot different from a 30 year jail sentence. “You feel trapped, and your income is limited.” Realizing his “good government job” was not going to make his dreams of being financially free come true, Tom took some real estate investing courses and bought his first house in 1983 at just 23 years old. Shortly thereafter he recognized a valuable asset available to him that his real estate investor competition did not have. 

Tom shares his out-of-the-box thinking and real-life real estate investing experiences by mentoring real estate Investors to reach their dreams of financial freedom. Visit http://www.tomnardonemillionairemailman.com for more information.",2008-09-02 03:25:41+00:00,5327.0555849619095,238660,121,638

From Ken Ehrlich, veteran executive producer of the Grammy Awards and a multi-Emmy Award nominee, the two-hour special will feature an all-star group of music superstars who will pay tribute to Elvis, recreating the spectacle - even the staging - of that legendary night. Elvis' December 3, 1968 special was his first live television performance since 1961 and a monumental television event. Dressed in a black leather jumpsuit and playing with a full band in front of an intimate audience, the telecast was hugely popular and was, in fact, the No. 1-rated show on NBC that season. In addition to musical performances, the special will showcase rare Elvis footage, outtakes and interviews from those involved in the special, including Director Steve Binder. Whether you're a lifelong fan or just getting to know Elvis, this is an event not to be missed. ""Elvis All-Star Tribute"" is executive produced by Ken Ehrlich and produced by Ken Ehrlich Productions.

All creators in this video have been featured in previous videos. Although, there is just simply too many creators used in this video to link every single one of them since YouTube only lets you have the description of your videos be 5000 characters long. If you want to find one of these creators, search them up either on twitch.tv or YouTube. Nametags for every creator is listed on the screen of their clip so make sure to check them out!

Please note: On Gamers React, you will discover highly edited gaming clips from streamers. Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the person’s speech or have some other kind of edit).

The undefeated Davis (20-0, 19 KOs) scored three knockdowns in less than three rounds to win his second title in the super featherweight division. The 23-year-old connected on 49 percent of his power shots in his first bout with new trainer Kevin Cunningham.

Davis utilized a combination of body shots, uppercuts and effective counterpunching to break down Cuellar, a former titlist at 126-pounds. Baltimore's Davis floored Cuellar with a body blow in the second round and didn't relent from there. The southpaw pressed forward in the third, stalking Cuellar against the ropes and sending him down for the second time with a series of combinations. Cuellar (28-3, 21 KOs) got up, but was in serious trouble and referee Benjy Esteves stepped in to halt the contest at 2:45 with the Argentine falling to the canvas for the third time.

740,wDRdK392pnk,"Garcia vs Porter FULL FIGHT: September 8, 2018 | PBC on Showtime","Shawn Porter became WBC Welterweight World Champion Saturday night as he earned a narrow unanimous decision victory over Danny Garcia in a hotly contested fight live on SHOWTIME from Barclays Center the home of BROOKLYN BOXING™, in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions.

All three judges scored the fight in favor of Porter (116-112, 115-113, 115-113) in an electrifying fight in front of 13,058 fans at the 30th professional boxing event at Barclays Center. 

Porter earned the belt that Keith Thurman, who previously defeated Porter and Garcia, was forced to vacate due to an injury.

In an anticipated title fight that was widely regarded as a 50-50 contest in boxing's deepest division, Garcia vs. Porter played out as advertised. The difference in total power punches landed throughout the 12-round battle was just five, with Garcia holding the narrow advantage.

In a matchup of accuracy vs. activity, Porter looked to outworked Garcia. He was relentless in his attack and threw 742 total punches and 544 power punches, landing 25 percent. Garcia, on the other hand, was the more precise fighter, landing the higher percentage and more meaningful punches. He connected on 46 percent of the 304 power punches he threw. Due to the contrasting styles, the three judges were only able to all agree on four rounds.

""I made a prediction and a hard one to live up to,"" said Porter. ""I said I wasn't leaving New York without this belt and I'm not leaving New York without this belt.

""I knew he was going to be accurate. The game plan for me was to be accurate from the outside and show I could beat him without roughing him up on the ropes.""

A disappointed Garcia clearly disagreed with the judges' scorecards.

""He was throwing a lot,"" said Garcia, who falls to 7-2 in world title fights. ""I had my defense tight, so I wasn't feeling his punches. I thought I landed the clearer shots and won this fight.

""I have to sit back, relax and see what's next for me.""

741,vxw3x1zVvEE,"Fury vs Wilder 3 FULL FIGHT: October 9, 2021 | PBC on FOX PPV","(Oct. 9, 2021) In an incredible back-and-forth that included five knockdowns and countless exchanges, Tyson Fury retained his WBC Heavyweight World Title and lineal crown with an eleventh-round TKO win over former long-time champion Deontay Wilder in an ESPN+/FOX Sports pay-per-view live from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

The UK’s Fury (31-0-1, 22 KOs) scored three knockdowns in all, the final two in the eleventh frame, sending the raucous crowd of 15,820 into a frenzy.

Fury got off to a hot start in the first round, landing quick one-two’s while Wilder worked the jab to the body. A hard right toward the end of the round punctuated it for Fury, as did another in the second.

The action heated up in the third when a big Fury right sent Wilder tumbling to the canvas. The game slugger from Tuscaloosa, Alabama rose to his feet, surviving the follow-up until the bell rang moments later.

With Wilder (42-2-1, 41 KOs) on unsteady legs in the fourth, Fury pounced, looking to finish him off. But just when it appeared that the fight was about to end, the “Bronze Bomber” uncorked a perfect short right followed by another, driving Fury to the mat.

Fury made it to his feet but was down again moments later when another Wilder flurry floored him. The bell rang seconds after he got up.

Wilder started strong in the fifth, blasting Fury with more rights. The “Gypsy King” maintained his composure, digging to the body in close quarters.

The inside work slowly wore Wilder down. He was dropped again in the tenth from another Fury right and then a third and final time in the eleventh via a crunching right cross. Referee Russell Mora mercifully rescued the brave warrior, ending the fight at 1:10 of the round.

742,2AtlEV2KBmU,Joshua vs Franklin FULL FIGHT HIGHLIGHTS 🥊 #BANTAMentertainment,"Former two-time heavyweight boxing
champion ANTHONY JOSHUA managed to
clinch a win after a less-than-stellar performance
in a unanimous points victory over JERMAINE FRANKLIN. 

The British fighter lost three of his last five
contests, including consecutive losses to
Oleksandr Usyk. 

""I would have liked a knockout, but it's
important to get the win,"" Joshua said.
He regularly landed with his left jab and
caught Franklin several times with his powerful
right. 

A bizarre finish saw the 12th round appearing to
end eight seconds early before Joshua pushed his
head into Franklin.

Judges scored the fight 117-111, 117-111, and 118-111 for Joshua, who snaps a two-fight losing skid with the victory. Bad Left Hook unofficially scored the bout 118-110 for Joshua.

805,TGD8zKvRxc4,Harry Potter By Balenciaga | Step by Step Tutorial,"Here is How to make Harry Potter by Balenciaga Video:
The actual video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8RX3lIQDU


Lets start:

🔹 Generate the image prompts with ChatGPT 

ChatGPT - https://chat.openai.com/chat
ChatGPT prompts: 

1. ""Give me the 10 most popular Harry Potter characters, just the names.""

2.  ""Now, act as a Balenciaga fashion designer with 20 years of experience. I want you to dress each of these 10 characters in a unique Balenciaga piece for a runway show. Just write the name of the character and the piece. Remember, it's a 1990 fashion show.""

3.  ""Ok, now this is a prompt that I use to generate images from another AI image generation tool called Midjourney: '1990 screengrab of female model Hermione Granger wearing a grotesque black Balenciaga dress, fashion movie scene, Balenciaga commercial --ar 3:2 --v 5'. Just say 'Y' if you understand.""

4. ""I want you to rewrite the prompt but for every character, with the clothes you chose for them. Remember to write the prompt exactly as I pasted it, with the same format and parameters. Only change the gender of the model, the name of the character, and the description of the clothing. Do you understand? Please ask if you need more information.""

Theorists, we all know I love a good ARG. And Crow 64? Well, I had to dive in head first. Crow 64 is the ARG of the ""unfinished Nintendo 64 game"" called Catastrophe Crow. In the original video, we get the history of the game as well as our first playthrough footage. From there, it spread across the internet into a building mystery waiting to be figured out. Today, I am going to try to do just that.

837,ZQDCusHa6yY,Secrets of Gobekli Tepe: Unlocking the Mysteries of Prehistoric Human Events,"Göbekli Tepe is an archaeological site located in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. It is considered to be one of the oldest and most important archaeological sites in the world, with a history dating back to the Neolithic period. The site contains a series of circular and oval-shaped structures made of limestone, which were constructed by hunter-gatherers around 11,000 years ago. 

The discovery of Göbekli Tepe has forced researchers to rethink the way they view the transition from foraging to farming societies and the origins of human civilization. The site provides valuable insights into the social organization, religion, and technology of ancient human communities and its discoveries are still ongoing.

Get the Map of Black Holes poster and Professor Astro Cat books here: https://store.dftba.com/collections/domain-of-science
This is the Map of Black Holes which isn’t a map of where all the black holes are in space, it’s a concept map of the subject of black holes: laying out our current knowledge of them. Their structure including Schwarzschild radius or event horizon, the singularity, photon sphere, innermost stable orbit, accretion disk, Hawking radiation and the difference between rotating and non-rotating black holes. I also look at the evidence for their existence, the many ways we have detected them though x-ray astronomy, gravitational wave astronomy and radio astronomy. Then the many outstanding mysteries still to be solved including wormholes, the holographic theory and information paradox. They are very fascinating objects indeed.

872,IDFePbrq3i0,Black Panther Raised By A Lady Made Friendship With A Rottweiler｜PECO,"Black fluffy coat and big round eyes...
A bear? Or a cat?

It's a black panther!

She was abandoned by her own mother at a zoo in Siberia.

Victoria who had an experience in raising a big cat took her in and named her Luna. Luna grew up with Victoria's love.

Then Luna met a Rottweiler Venza. Venza thought she was her own child and started taking care of her gently. 

Just like a dog & a cat, their bond have been built and their friendship has been dynamic.

First visit this year by your favorite girl, Simone! AND YES, SHE BROUGHT HER FIRST EVER LITTER OF CUBS!!!! 

The collar is gone - nice! - and she looks well-fed. The cubs are the cutest things to ever have walked these woods, but then I'm kind of biased. 
Being that it's her first litter I tried my best not to spook her or the little ones. She seemed pretty comfortable with the proximity so I'm guessing we'll be seeing her again soon.

My content focuses on North America, but I strive to show the larger picture and at times cover significant international events as they occur.

I was entranced with the weather when I was 4, which is when I started watching forecasts on TV for around the nation. Since then, I haven't deviated from my passion for atmospheric science:
- Graduated UNC Asheville in Spring 2021
- Started working with Ryan in March 2022
- Became a published author in the American Meteorological Society in October 2022 

Now I've started this project here where I can be a leader in a paradigm shift of social meteorology; that is, changing how you get to know your weather!

Thanks for joining me along the way =)

Siempre se ha dicho que la división de las moléculas de agua ""H2O"" en sus átomos mediante la electrólisis no es suficientemente eficiente como para ser práctica... Pero un laboratorio ha desarrollado un electrolito capaz de darle la vuelta a esta tecnología. Y te la mostramos aquí, antes que nadie.

901,BowpUasB-Nw,Intense Close Range Intercept of Violent EF-4 Tornado - Iowa High Risk Tornado Outbreak - 3/31/23,"The first SPC issued ""High Risk"" (level 5/5) in over 2 years brought multiple strong-to-violent tornadoes to eastern Iowa on March 31st, 2023. This video includes footage from 2 or possibly 3 of those tornadoes, all spawned by the same parent supercell, as well as an intercept of a tornado-warned QLCS south of Iowa City, which brought large hail and high winds, along with torrential rain. Thankfully, nobody was killed from the tornadoes in Iowa. Sadly, many other areas were not as fortunate.

The close range wedge tornado featured in this video has been preliminarily rated EF-4 (violent) with maximum winds of 170 mph.

This is definitely my ""best"" chase to date, and one of the most intense moments of my life. I still cannot believe what I witnessed.

913,SuTNJhV4-rg,The December 2021 Derecho And Tornado Outbreak Retrospective,"RESOURCES USED: https://pastebin.com/JayQ98UD

Thumbnail Image by Colin Lloyd via Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/@onthesearchforpineapples?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText

Edit: Turns out, some transitions into some scenes are screwed up for some reason. However, I feel like it is not worth rendering it AGAIN for 10 HOURS, to fix something as a fade out not happening. Sorry if that bothers people. 

December, a month often associated with holiday festivities and spreading the holiday joy to those around their peers. For many early on in December in 2021, that was the case, well, until two notable severe weather events occurred across the United States. The most well known event, The December 10-11 Tornado Outbreak, was known for an EF4 tornado that impacted Bowling Green, Kentucky, and a large, long-track, wedge tornado that tore through Mayfield, Kentucky and multiple towns and cities in western Kentucky during the tornado's three hour duration, travelling 165 miles. The December 10-11 Outbreak broke the record for the most tornadoes in a tornado outbreak in the month of December, and is often the most well known and talked about tornado outbreak from 2021. However this video isn't about Mayfield. It's about what happened 4 days later. 

Not even a week had passed and something just as insane as the Mayfield outbreak occurred. In the upper plains and Midwest. In December. A Derecho that became one of the most prolific severe wind events in the United States History, with only the May 12, 2022 Outbreak being in close contention for the title for the most severe wind reports from a derecho. A derecho that began much earlier than expected, travelling over 700 miles in the span of roughly 8-9 hours total, impacting states such as Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. More notably though, the record that the Mayfield Outbreak had, the most tornadoes from a single outbreak in the month of December, was broken in less than a week from this derecho, with a total of 120 tornadoes touching down across the upper plains and midwest. Not ONLY was there a threat for a Derecho and tornado outbreak, but the threat of winter weather, wildfires, and strong winds were present across all areas impacted by the severe weather. Join me, as I breakdown one of the most complex significant weather events in recent memory.

931,s7Hno28xkpI,"BTS 지민, K팝 솔로 '최초' 미 빌보드 핫 100 싱글 1위 / SBS","〈앵커〉

그룹 방탄소년단, BTS 멤버 지민이 솔로 음반 타이틀곡 '라이크 크레이지'로 미국 빌보드 메인 싱글 차트 '핫 100' 1위에 올랐습니다. 한국 솔로 가수로 해당 차트 1위에 오른 건 이번이 처음입니다.

남주현 기자가 전해드립니다.

〈기자〉

빌보드가 공개한 이번 주 싱글 차트 1위 곡은 방탄소년단 지민의 '라이크 크레이지'입니다.

지민은 팝스타 마일리 사이러스, 컨트리 가수 모건 월렌 등 쟁쟁한 경쟁자를 제치고 정상에 올랐습니다.

지금까지 빌보드 '핫 100'에서 1위를 한 K팝 가수는 방탄소년단이 유일해 지민은 개인, 그룹으로 모두 '핫 100' 1위 고지를 밟은 최초의 K팝 가수가 됐습니다.

솔로 가수 종전 최고 순위 곡은 2012년 2위에 올랐던 싸이의 '강남스타일'입니다.

지민은 방탄소년단이어서 가능했다며 팬들에게 고마움을 전했습니다.

[지민/방탄소년단 멤버 : 이게 방탄이라서 가능한 거고, 아미 여러분들이 있으니까 가능한 거고, 그거를 절대 모르지 않습니다.]

'라이크 크레이지'는 지민의 첫 공식 솔로 음반 타이틀곡으로, 강렬한 신시사이저·드럼 사운드에 지민의 애절한 음색이 대조를 이룬다는 평가를 받습니다.

'라이크 크레이지'는 앞서 미국 빌보드와 함께 세계 양대 차트로 꼽히는 영국 오피셜 싱글 차트 '톱 100'에는 8위로 진입했습니다.

 [리포트]

 [""lost in the light...""]

 강렬한 신시사이저와 드럼, 여기에 귀에 감기는 애절한 음색이 절묘한 대조를 이룹니다.

 그룹 방탄소년단 지민의 첫 솔로 음반 페이스의  타이틀곡인 라이크 크레이집니다.

 동명의 영화에서 영감을 받아 곡 작업에 직접 참여했다는 지민은, 상처를 잊기 위해 현실을 외면하는 순간의 감정을 표현한 곡이라고 소개한 바 있습니다.

 빌보드는 오늘 공식 트위터를 통해 이번 주 싱글 차트 핫100의 상위 10개 곡을 공개했습니다.

 여기서 쟁쟁한 노래들을 제치고 지민의 라이크 크레이지가 정상에 오른 겁니다.

 [지민/위버스/발표 직후 : ""여러분이 훨씬 자랑스럽고 방탄이 자랑스럽고 같이 작업해주신 모든 분들이 자랑스럽습니다.""]

 이전까지 빌보드 싱글 차트에서 1위를 한 K팝 가수는 솔로와 그룹을 모두 합쳐서 방탄소년단이 유일합니다.

 걷는 길이 곧 역사였던 방탄소년단은 2020년 다이너마이트를 시작으로 2021년 마이유니버스까지 총 6곡의 싱글 차트 1위 곡을 보유하고 있습니다.

 특히 지민은 개인으로 또 그룹으로도 빌보드 싱글 차트 1위를 달성한 최초의 한국 가수라는 타이틀도 갖게 됐습니다.

 지금까지 솔로 가수 중에는 싸이가 강남스타일로  7주 연속 2위를 한 게 최고 기록이었습니다.

 [지민/가수/지난달 31일/KBS2TV 뮤직뱅크 : ""많이 부족하지만 좀 느리지만 앞으로 더 열심히 천천히 더 정진해나가도록하겠습니다.""]

 한편 지민은 방탄소년단 RM과 함께 라이크 크레이지의 송라이터로 이름을 올렸습니다.

 이로써 지민은 싱글 차트 1위곡 송라이터라는 기록도 처음으로 갖게 됐고, RM은 버터, 마이 유니버스 등에 이어 4번쨉니다.

Now, it’s really there.” He closed the year with a self-released EP, Cortlandt Baby. Across six unique tracks, B flexed his range. The melodic “Hero” chronicled an unlikely path to success, while “Only One” showed a rapper with a standout flow. “People will see what you’re doing and try to do it too,” says the artist who is intent on being original and outmaneuvering the copycats. This summer, B-Lovee further separated himself from the pack with “IYKYK.” Grabbing melodic elements from Wayne Wonder’s 2003 hit “No Letting Go,” B rapped about his command of the block. In September, the seven-figure streaming song was broadcast on HOT 97 and hit Apple Music playlists, including The New New York, New In Hip Hop, and The Plug. As the track thrives on TikTok and Shazam, “IYKYK” was praised by Pitchfork and Lyrical Lemonade.

And check out part 2 here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mugPH2_qRo

HELLO FRIENDS! After many weeks... here is the video that almost defeated me, the grand finale of our Vegas trip - where we ate at every celebrity chef restaurant on the Vegas strip! Now as some of you all may know, Tyler and I are big Food Network fans - and while we were in Vegas, we decided to visit one of every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip! We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?

Also, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies. If you'd like to know more, here are a couple of links to some more information -

968,UrkPC81_QfU,How Retail Stores Manipulate You,"HELLO FRIENDS!! a bit of an experimental video here, but i hope you guys like it... 

Have you ever wondered why you always get lost in IKEA? Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase! This is the first of a 3-part series we're gonna be working on throughout the year!

A big thank you to Jen Clinehens for helping us out with this video; make sure to check out her YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowLiketheGreatest

And thanks so much to Julia from Agile Styling for her consult! You can find her website and find out more about her color matching and styling services here: https://www.agilestyling.com/

And follow her on TikTok & Instagram at: @agile_styling !

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today it’s all about color - and as someone who is known for wearing almost only black, I decided to dip my toes into the personal color analysis trend I've been hearing about for years and seeing all over TikTok. Because I've always been curious... am I a winter? Autumn? Summer? Or even Spring? Pastels have never been my forte, but I was open to at least *hearing* about them. So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I’d been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?

Also, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‌thecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process. Accurate results can only be achieved through their color analysis process!!

Bio
Best known for founding evo magazine with a group of talented motoring journalists back in 1998 which, much to our surprise, went on to become a global player in the automotive media arena. Also wrote stuff for Octane Magazine and Sunday Times. 
Left evo in September 2013 and became an outside advisor to Jaguar Land Rover 2013-18, helping JLR set up Special Operations.  

Hooked on cars from an early age, although my first love was motorbikes, the first one arriving when I was 11. Swapped to 4-wheels when I turned 17 and have been lucky enough to have owned or driven almost every interesting car ever made. This YouTube channel is my way of sharing this passion for all things motoring with an equally passionate audience.

979,eItCv1Pxccg,I drove the most powerful BMW M car EVER!,"Meet the all-new BMW XM! 

It’s the first BMW M-exclusive SUV, and Mat’s about to find out if it’s worth the eye-watering £147,000+ price tag! 

For starters, let’s check out the design - and there’s no denying it’s certainly eye-catching! With a huge grille with horizontal slats up front, the XM looks like an absolute beast! There’s gold trim to be found from the front to the rear, and around the back, you’ll even find stacked horizontal tailpipes! 

The impressive looks continue on the inside too, with a huge curved infotainment screen, super-comfy leather sports seats, and soft-touch materials throughout the cabin. There’s even a futuristic 3D-printed headliner! 

Under the bonnet, you’ll find an almighty 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 that can produce 653hp and 800Nm of torque. Although in the future a Label Red edition is due which will produce 748hp!

So it’s all pretty impressive, right? But is it really worth around £150,000?! Stick with Mat and see for yourself!

980,CkjT_jNYI4w,New BMW M2 review with 0-60mph & auto vs manual!,"This is the all-new BMW M2! 

Mat’s headed over to America to get his hands on this all-new sports coupe, and he’s about to find out if it’s a worthy successor to the previous M2, and whether it can compete with the likes of the Porsche Cayman or even the M3! 

Well when it comes to the design, it’s had a serious overhaul over the regular 2 Series. It’s got a large squared kidney grille up front, bulging wheel arches over the side, a carbon fibre roof and quad tailpipes at the back. All-in-all, it’s certainly meaner and more aggressive than the regular 2 Series. 

It’s a similar story on the inside, with several changes made over the standard car. As you’d expect there’s a smattering of M tricolour to be found throughout, a fair bit of carbon fibre, and M-specific digital dial graphics. It also comes with sport bucket seats. 

Then let’s take a look under the bonnet! It comes with the same 3-litre twin-turbo straight-six as found in the M3, but the output has been dialled down slightly, so it’ll produce 460hp and 550Nm of torque. This power is delivered to the rear wheels only, and unlike the M3, you can pick the M2 up as either a manual or an automatic! 

The price starts from around £65,000, but is it really worth it? There’s only one way to find out - stick with Mat for this all-new review!

Supercars offer exhilarating performance and a gratifying driving experience, all wrapped up in stunningly beautiful aesthetics. They are also exorbitantly priced, which means that buying new is normally reserved for CEOs or lottery winners who can afford both the purchase price and the possible depreciation. Yet, if you shop around, you may find a multitude of cheaper supercars on the used market.
Hello everyone, and welcome to a brand new video on the channel. Today, we are going to talk about the 10 cheapest supercars you can afford.

Speed is an expensive habit, and the more you pay, the more you get. Take our long-term 2022 BMW M3. We could have spent more for the more powerful Competition trim or the quicker all-wheel-drive variant. Instead, we went with the $70,895 base model, which not only was less expensive but also allowed us to get a manual transmission. Our 2022 manual-transmission M3 delivered a lot of grins and very few gremlins over 40,000 miles.

This year’s crop of cars doesn’t look too different from that first event’s, when we ran a Corvette Z06 but not one with a mid-engine 670-hp V-8. A Cayman appeared on the first roster, although it was not nearly as track focused as this year’s Cayman GT4 RS.

There have been massive performance increases in the past 17 years, and not just for Porsches and Corvettes. The Honda Civic Type R offers 315 horsepower from the factory. Toyota fielded two cars: the rally-inspired GR Corolla and a manual-transmission-equipped Supra. Zero Hyundais appeared in 2006, but two this year—Kona N and Elantra N—returned times that might surprise you. BMW sent the M4 CSL and the electric i4 M50; both were significantly quicker than the 2006 M6 in the first event.

A new Subaru WRX and Audi RS3 brought a rally-car experience at two different price points. After a few issues with the BMW M240i, the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, and the Volkswagen GTI last year, we invited them back for a chance to improve their lap times. Mercedes and Lamborghini were missing from the first roster, but this year we lapped the new SL63, a 2+2 with all-wheel drive, and Lamborghini brought out a Huracán Tecnica, a less extreme version of the Huracán STO.

984,j1ivstMmAGk,2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Quick Review,"Today on Extra Throttle House, Thomas and James check out the all new Hyundai Ioniq 6 in its “Ultimate Trim.” Costing 64,689 CAD (57,215 USD), this Hyundai aims to disrupt the EV Sedan market - but its stiffest competition comes from within its own brand. With similar pricing and range to the Ioniq 5, the guys answer the age old question - should 5 be afraid of 6? And what will happen when the 7 comes to market in the coming months? Is Hyundai just cannibalizing itself within its own nomenclature? Watch - SUBSCRIBE!

986,Eo_VcY-E14Y,Ferrari Purosangue DRIVEN: Worth £400k? | Top Gear,"So then, the Purosangue. In literal terms 'pureblood'. There's a V12 up front and all-wheel drive, but more importantly, four doors and four seats. Controversial. There's also a hatch and a decent enough boot, Ferrari even has plans for ski and bike carriers – carbon fibre and fabulously expensive, obviously – and the sense that if practicality had been skinned down to the bare essentials in favour of Ferrari-ness, you'd be looking at it. 

The 6.5-litre V12 produces 715bhp, enough to launch the Purosangue from 0-62mph in 3.3 seconds. Sprightly... But how does it fare on Italy's snow covered mountain roads? Top Gear Magazine's Associate Editor, Tom Ford, finds out.

987,bNkM-z3cPW8,2023 Corvette Z06 vs Ferrari 458 vs Porsche GT3 | Top Gear,"The ‘Z06’. If the Corvette is America’s Porsche 911, this is its GT3. And in American sports car folklore there is no bigger deal. But for Chevy’s latest it’s bucked the trend; no electric assistance, no hybrid help, and no turbos either. It’s got an entirely new engine, the LT6 - a 5.5-litre dry sump, flat-plane crank V8 taken from the C8R GTLM race car. Good for 670bhp and 459lb ft, it sees off 0–60mph in 2.7secs. It also sounds more Italian than American, like the great engine from a Ferrari 458. So we thought we’d bring one of those along. And Porsche’s GT3, because we’re thorough. But could this be America’s best sports car ever? Top Gear Magazine’s Ollie Marriage hit the road and track to find out.

But a massive snow storm dumped a large amount of snow and crazy winds about blew me off the mountain. Getting home turned out to be a bigger challenge than I anticipated and I ended up helping some stuck drivers along the way. Defiantly one of the more intense endings to a video I have ever done.

999,C8UxyMrBu4I,Man Leaves City to Create Beautiful Permaculture Farm,"14 years ago, Crispin Moorey quit his city job to start a beautiful permaculture farm and homestead in the Japanese countryside together with his wife Kazumi. Dissatisfied with their life in the city, they craved a deeper connection to nature. Their unique off-grid permaculture farm and homestead includes many self-built structures such as a yurt, a shed and a barn as well as a productive mandala garden. Crispin's permaculture farm is a great example of regenerative agriculture and shows that it is possible to carve out a living from taking good care of Mother Earth. Crispin and his wife add value to the crops they grow by turning them into delicious shelf-stable products first, processing and packaging everything in-house before selling them directly to their customers across Japan.

1031,Dqn7NQ228w0,Leaky Vintage Floor Jack Restoration (Hein Werner),"My dad has had this car jack for years. He bought it used and apparently the previous owner made some interesting modifications to it... They used to use these things to re-bend vehicle frames back into shape after an accident which put a lot of stress on them. Anyway it was leaking pretty bad and wouldn't lift up a car anymore so I decided I'd rebuild it for him and make a restoration video out of it. 

I started this restoration project a few years ago, but after I tore it apart I realized I'd need a lathe to actually fix it up properly. It sat in a storage bin for years in pieces  until I got a lathe and enough courage to try and put it all back together. Sorry the video ended up being a feature length film... I couldn't really cut it down much more and I don't like multi-part series.

What do the North Pole and our cabin have in common? We're both experiencing a polar vortex!! If you're not familiar with the term, it's basically extremely cold storm of ice and snow, normally only found at the North and South poles of our planet. But occasionally, the storm comes down south, and temperatures drop as low as -40! This can result in icy weather as far south as California, Texas and even Mexico. In the past we've escaped to warmer weather in our van, but this time we've decided to stay in the eye of the storm and embrace the weather in the woods! As you can imagine, braving a storm with limited supplies and power off the grid poses additional challenges. One of our main sources of heat is our wood stove, which makes things precarious when we run out of wood. So we raided our stash and got enough to hopefully last the storm. And speaking of logs, we finally got our Cinderella incinerator toilet working!! Yes, it literally burns our poop! And no, we won't be using that as a heat source. We made due with our wood stove, though it was still freezing. And while not having to go to the bathroom outside was a game changer, we gave a little peak behind the scenes on how frustrating it's been not being able to wash the dishes--something that's easy to take for granted. But despite these challenges, we were still able to find joy in the beauty of the storm, and reaffirmed that we can truly handle anything life throws our way, as long as we have each other! Do you have any tips on making it through the cold months? What keeps you going? Comment below!

Our Journey! How did we get here?
In the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands. Thank you for being here with us for cabin life, van life and all the in between!

1068,dVO-7rchstw,Silicon Valley Bank MELTDOWN Explained | How to PREPARE for the RECESSION | Jaspreet Singh,"Learn how to build IRONCLAD discipline in this free workshop:
https://bit.ly/3QGo7ln

On Today's Episode: 
Here’s how the second-biggest bank collapse in U.S. history happened in just 48 hours. Silicon Valley Bank closed its doors today. Within 48 hours, a panic induced by the very venture capital community that SVB had served and nurtured ended the bank’s 40-year-run.

Regulators shuttered SVB Friday and seized its deposits in the largest U.S. banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis and the second-largest ever. The company’s downward spiral began late Wednesday, when it surprised investors with news that it needed to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its balance sheet. What followed was the rapid collapse of a highly-respected bank that had grown alongside its technology clients.
You are not alone if the recession has you nervous about what to expect. People have real concerns about whether or not they’ll be able to afford groceries, gas, and even rent! 

For sure you’ve heard that millionaires are made in recessions, but how?

Jaspreet Singh is joining Tom for a second time to get you up to speed on what it takes to get wealthy during any recession. Jaspreet is the Minority Mindset guru and Chief Money Nerd at Minority Mindset Companies. He’s been creating financial education videos on YouTube for years and is breaking down all the reason you don’t have to be scared during a recession

Jaspreet is a voice of reason to remember that recessions are only bad or good in relation to which side of the equation you are on. This is a must watch if you’re trying to find the best route through a recession that has most people nervous and panicked.

Really more of a cake, this bake-speriment attempts to answer the age-old question ""How many different cookies can you combine in a single cookie recipe?"". My lawyers tell me I can't recommend anyone actually make this recipe, but if you really want to give it a try (at your own risk, of course!) here's the recipe for each component, assembly instructions are in the video.

*Double Cookie Cookies*
Adapted from a recipe by Christina Tosi (Milkbar).

*Ingredients*
• 225 g (1 cup, 2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
• 300 g (1 ½ cups) granulated sugar 
• 100 g (⅓ cup) glucose
• 1 egg
• 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
• 60 g (⅓ cup) 55% chocolate, melted
• 200 g (1 ⅔ cup)  all-purpose flour
• 100 g (2 ¼ cups) cocoa powder
• ¾ tsp. baking powder 
• ½ tsp.  baking soda 
• 1 ¾ tsp. kosher salt
Approx. ½ cup of mini cookie cereal such as Cookie Crisp® or Chips Ahoy® 

*Directions*
1.  Combine the butter, sugar, and glucose in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Cream together on medium-high for 2-3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the spatula, add the egg, vanilla, and melted chocolate, and beat for 7-8 minutes until very light and fluffy.

2. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Using a 2 3⁄4 -ounce ice cream scoop (or a 1/3-cup measure), scoop double portions (i.e. two scoops per cookie) of the dough onto a parchment or silicone baking mat lined baking sheet. You don’t need to leave space between the cookies at this point, as they’ll be refrigerated before baking.

3. Pat the tops of the cookie dough domes a little bit flat with your hand, and place as many mini cereal cookies on top of each dough round as you like. Keep in mind the cookies will spread a fair bit while baking, so you may want to really crowd the cereal cookies on.

4. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week. If you bake your cookies from room temperature, they will spread more and bake flatter than intended.

5. Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190° C). Bake for 14–16  minutes, until spread and puffed. With how dark the cookies are it will be difficult to tell when they’re done based on colour alone. When they’ve lost their shine, they should be good to go. You may want to bake just one cookie first and let it cool completely to work out the best timing for your oven.
Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pans before transferring to a plate or an airtight container for storage. At room temperature, the cookies will keep fresh for 5 days; in the freezer, they will keep for 1 month.

*Oreo® Cookie Butter Pucks*
Makes enough for 4 giant cookie sandwiches.

*Ingredients*
• 4 Oreo cookies, any flavour you like. I used Double-Stuf® Oreos
• 1 - 14 oz jar of Speculoos Cookie Butter spread

*Directions*
1. Line 4 wells of a metal standard size muffin tin with paper liners, or use a silicone muffin tin (no need to line or butter the wells).

2. Microwave the cookie butter for 15–30 seconds at a time, or until melted enough to pour. It will likely take around 1 minute in total. Make sure to remove every last bit of the foil liner from the lid of the jar before microwaving.

3. Fill 4 wells of the muffin tin about a third to a half of the way up. Press an Oreo® cookie into each well.

4. Top with an equal amount of cookie butter, and spread as flat as you can. Freeze until completely solid, 1–2 hours. Leave in the freezer until cookies are ready to assemble.

*Edible Cookie Dough Frosting*
Makes enough for 4 giant cookie sandwiches.

*Ingredients*
• 454 g (4 sticks, 2 cups) unsalted butter, at room temperature (226 g)
• 215 g (1 cup) light brown sugar (108 g)
• 340 g (3 cups) powdered sugar (170 g)
• 1 tbsp. + 1 tsp. Vanilla extract (2 tsp)
• ½–¾ cup Milk or cream
• 80 g (⅔ cup) all-purpose flour (40 g)
• 1 tsp. Kosher salt 

*Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Spread the flour onto a baking tray. Bake in the oven for 10–15 minutes, and allow to cool completely. This kills any bacteria in the flour making it safe to eat in a raw cookie dough, so don’t skip this step!

2. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream the butter until smooth and very fluffy, about 3–5 minutes.

3. Scrape down the bowl.  Add the sugars and mix thoroughly.

4. Add the flour and mix until just combined. 

5. Add the salt and vanilla, and beat for about 1 minute more until fluffy again.

6. Add the milk or cream a little at a time until the consistency of frosting.

7. Cover the mixer bowl with plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to assemble the cookies (or leave at room temperature for up to 2 hours). If it has firmed up too much to pipe while in the fridge, you will need to take it out 20–30 minutes earlier and re-whip it to soften up before piping.",2023-03-05 19:19:39+00:00,705.4341854252777,13,Lowbrow Fancy,UC4U_Y_6rTnHUhMuYTGK2wdg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3h37e4e3bQ/default.jpg,120,90,234,hd,True,786,39.0,0,4.0,,2022-08-19 13:28:15+00:00,227.63713588783563,19640,33,140

1081,ZcGlf7EZ-vU,Zion Williamson VS LaMelo Ball!!!  LIVEST Game Of The Year Full Highlights!,"This had to be the craziest AAU environment I've ever been apart of. It was standing room only 3 hours before the game started.  Two thousand people were turned away.  There was even an incident that were hundreds of people broke down doors and rushed into the venue. There was even rumors floating around that LeBron and his son were encourage to stay away due to the chaos.  Lavar being Lavar took a bathroom break during the middle of the game.

1087,kG9MM_7Wtvg,What Happened to Julian Newman?,"What Happened to Julian Newman? 

This video is presented with educational purposes to detail the rise of Julian Newman from a childhood of being a basketball prodigy to his unfortunate downfall as an adult. Since Julian garnered the attention of millions around the world at such a young age, he has left many wondering, ""What exactly happened to Julian Newman?"" After doing my research and reading numerous articles, I've broken it down to three major reasons as to why his stardom peaked before adulthood. Even though he graduated high school without any college scholarship offers or professional basketball offers, I wish him nothing but the best. He is still young and if he dedicates himself to understanding the game of basketball, I believe Julian can still play at the next level of basketball. After all, as I mentioned in the video, he is a very skilled player who just lacks some key elements of basketball. If Julian learned how to master the parts of his game that aren't the strongest, Julian has a strong case for being able to play college ball or professional basketball somewhere. Thank you for watching, enjoy!

Lyrics
Ay ojalá que nunca se apague la luz 
que tienen tus ojos
que nunca te falte nada
porque tu te mereces todo
tú eres la culpable que yo existo en este mundo loco 
ay la única mujer que esta vida 
nunca me ha dejado solo

Como te pago, 
con lo que te mereces
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses
Ay dime como te pago 
con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses

Antes decía mami y ahora te digo mamá
ay gracias por enseñarme a hablar y a caminar
madrecita de mi vida 
no te me vayas jamás 
ay porque voy a llorar y voy a llorar 
si tu te me vas

Como te pago 
con lo que te mereces
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses
Ay dime Como te pago
 con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses

Hay quien tiene a su madre lejos y otros no la tienen
hay quien tiene a su madre en la casa pero no la quiere
como yo amo a la mía 
con este amor profundo 
porque para mi el amor de una madre es el más grande del mundo

Como te pago 
con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses
Ay dime Como te pago 
con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses

Y ojalá que dios me le dé mucha salud 
mucha bendición 
pa mi madre
Dicelo Mauro
Lenier 
Mambo

Letra: 
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente
Es como tapar una herida con maquillaje, no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me está' viendo toa' la historia' (No; papi)

Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (-íto')
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errores no repito (Ey, papi)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte (Ah)
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen los reporte'
Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al menos yo te tenía bonito (Shakira, Shakira)

Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más leve
Volver contigo never, tú eres la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía
Tú buscando por fuera la comida
Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida
Pero si ella supiera que me busca' todavía

Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito (Mueve el culito)
Que no tiene buena mano, y al menos yo te tenía bonito

O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Mi amor, es que usted se alejó mucho
Y yo de lejos ya no veo, bebé
TQM pero TQG, jajaja

Lyrics:
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

See it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever (lasts forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (last together)

🌻 READ BEFORE COMMENTING
Create a fun and lighthearted comment section. I’ll be happy to take constructive criticism if it means it’ll help me make better compilations in the future, but I will not tolerate straight up child-like behavior in my comment section. If hate is being sent to me or the creators in my compilations for absolutely no reason then I can easily delete those comments and block you because I don’t want to see it and I don’t want anyone else seeing it. If your only purpose is to spread hate, then please go somewhere else because no one asked for your opinion.

1127,qFLCyvoCQas,【サーキットレビュー】アストンマーティン ヴァルキリー,"UKチャンネル投稿日 2023/03/07

ついにマットがアストンマーティンのヴァルキリーを試乗する時が来ました！

彼は中東のバーレーン インターナショナル サーキットに飛び、公道走行可能なF1マシンを実際に走らせて、実際にハンドルを握ったときの狂気ぶりを確認します。

ヴァルキリーの魅力は何でしょうか？
まず、ヴァルキリーの空力担当であるエイドリアンは、4つの要素が重要であると言います。フロントウイングを担うボンネットや、後ろの巨大なリアディフューザーなど、さまざまな空力の工夫がなされているそうです。その結果、ヴァルキリーは、今までに見たことのないような外観に仕上がりました。

内装は収納こそ少ないものの、車載スクリーンやエアコンなど、クルマとしての機能は充実しています。

そしてもちろん、驚異的なパワーユニットも搭載しています。6.5Lの自然吸気V12エンジンと電気モーターを組み合わせたヴァルキリーは、最高出力1,001馬力、最大トルク924Nmを発生します。また、レブリミッターは11,000RPMにもなります！ 

問題は、ヴァルキリーが見た目と同様にサーキットで絶大な力を発揮できるかということです。マットは公道走行可能なF1マシンの脅威的ななパワーを扱えるのでしょうか? この動画を最後まで見て、それをあなたの目で確かめてみましょう！

IL NARCOFUTBOL

Oscar Cordoba, il portiere, è appena rimasto piantato nel terreno, con le ginocchia in avanti e il corpo totalmente all’indietro. Sembra un manichino rotto, buttato lì in un magazzino, pronto per essere smaltito. E se la storia non fosse questa, se fosse soltanto il racconto di una partita di calcio, si potrebbe dire che la sua postura ricorda quella di una persona a cui hanno appena sparato. Ma non è un’analogia che si può usare, perché questa storia finirà davvero con dei proiettili. Oscar Cordoba è stato preso alla sprovvista dalla deviazione inaspettata di Andres Escobar, uno dei difensori più forti e più eleganti che il calcio colombiano abbia mai visto. Il numero 2 della selezione cafetera ha messo il piede su un cross rasoterra, e la partita contro gli Stati Uniti è appena diventata un Everest, impossibile da scalare. Ma per arrivare all’epilogo dobbiamo partire da lontano e scoprire perché, nel 1994, pensare alla Colombia tra le favorite per la vittoria di un Mondiale non era un’eresia. E anche perché una squadra così quotata si è sbriciolata in questo modo, in due partite: la teorica fine gloriosa di una generazione d’oro che si trasforma in un dramma in mondovisione. Una volta rimessi insieme tutti i pezzi del puzzle, diventerà chiaro anche il motivo che porta un bambino, vedendo suo padre in televisione deviare un pallone che forse avrebbe dovuto lasciare sfilare, a confidare alla mamma la paura di vedere il suo eroe ucciso. Una profezia che si sarebbe tristemente, tragicamente, avverata.

«El narcotrafico toca todo, es un pulpo. El futbol es una isla? No». 
(Francisco Pacho Maturana)

Una sola qualificazione ai Mondiali dal 1938 al 1986. La storia calcistica della Colombia era stata a lungo marginale, con un solo acuto degno di nota: il secondo posto nella Copa America del 1975. Ci era arrivata sfruttando una formula particolare, che aveva spedito l’Uruguay campione in carica direttamente in semifinale e aveva diviso le altre nove squadre in tre gironi. Ma Argentina e Brasile erano finite insieme nel Gruppo A, con il Venezuela a fare da vittima sacrificale: 26 gol subiti in 4 partite. Il Brasile si era fatto strada vincendo i due scontri diretti e presentandosi così alla semifinale contro il Perù, guidato da un giocatore sublime come Teofilo Cubillas. La Colombia aveva approfittato di un girone morbido e aveva spazzato via l’Uruguay, costruendo la qualificazione nel match di andata a Bogotà e rendendo indolore la sconfitta di Montevideo. Sempre a Bogotà, nella finale di andata, Ponciano Castro aveva illuso il popolo colombiano, salvo dover poi fare i conti con il bruciante 2-0 subito a Lima. Il format della Coppa, a quel punto, prevedeva una gara di spareggio, da giocare in campo neutro, e non l’assegnazione della coppa al Perù alla luce del doppio confronto. A Caracas, il 28 ottobre del 1975, era stato Hugo Sotil, el Cholo, un genio che si era guadagnato la chiamata prestigiosa del Barcellona, a risolvere la contesa e a relegare la Colombia al secondo posto. La Federcalcio colombiana immaginava che quella Copa America potesse rappresentare lo slancio in vista dell’organizzazione del Mondiale del 1986, conquistata un anno prima, ma il Paese non era stato in grado di rispettare i dettami della Fifa e nel 1982 aveva dovuto rinunciare all’incarico.  Poi, all’improvviso, erano arrivati i soldi. Una cascata di soldi.",2023-03-09 12:06:00+00:00,616.6616854252777,29,CRONACHE DI SPOGLIATOIO,UCfmCGVXfpAMSi4PP8kqWlbA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xxV7ubH94aU/default.jpg,120,90,1541,hd,False,202788,7045.0,0,183.0,,2018-02-14 14:03:41+00:00,1874.612529406354,52972269,306,306000

Bisa dibilang deontay wilder kini hanya petinju biasa yang kesulitan untuk bertarung, selain karena dia masih berbahaya juga karena dia tidak mempunyai gelar untuk diperebutkan. Deontay wilder sebelumnya adalah seorang petinju luar biasa yang tak terkalahkan dan memegang gelar dunia wbc kelas berat sebelum dia dikalahkan oleh seorang Tysn Fury. Dia kalh sebanyak dua kali oleh petiju yang sama yaitu tyson fury. Deontay wilder vs tyson fury dianggap sebagai pertarungan terbaik dikelas berat era saat ini karena menampilkan pertarungan yang sangat luar biasa dan digelar sebanyak 3 kali. sebuah pertarungan yang tidak mungkin tidak menarik karena digelar 3 kali. Fury vs wilder 4 kini digadang gadang untuk digelar lagi sebab wilder kesulitan mencari lawan dan hanya seorang tyson fury yang mempunyai cara untuk mengalahkannya. boxing news full fight tyson fury vs wilder.

I get to raise an animal that faced near extinction at one point, and is now a living history. In March 2018, we started raising our small herd of six bison. These are amazing animals. We are learning more and more about them. We want to continue to grow our herd through conservation and promotion of a healthy meat. We hope to educate and share our experiences with anyone who wants to follow us along on our journey of the great American Bison.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎

We started our YouTube channel on a whim when we decided to take a year off and go travel back in 2016. One year quickly turned into 4, and at the very end of 2019 we stepped foot in our 100th country. If you want a quick summary of that journey you can watch the documentary here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg

Shortly after achieving our 100 country goal, the pandemic hit. With international travel no longer an option, we bought a van and spent two years traveling around the U.S. living in our tiny home on wheels.

At the beginning of 2022, we moved out of the van and back into our suitcases full-time. We're not exactly sure what our next ""goal"" is going to be, but we're currently having fun bouncing around the globe chasing our passions and interesting stories.

1156,Q_BYtobvwl8,First Class on a Ritz Carlton Luxury Cruise | Evrima,"Check out Carl Friedrik's “The Luggage Set” here: https://friedrik.com/0m2

Today I’m taking one of the world’s most luxurious cruises for 5 days across the Caribbean. This is the long awaited Ritz Carlton Yacht, Evrima. Scheduled to launch in 2020, this was pushed back around 8 times until finally last October she was launched. I’ve experienced a few luxury cruises now, but this was different. With far fewer passengers, the level of staffing should be an unparalleled experience onboard.

I'll show you the entire experience from boarding in Florida, touring my suite along with the most luxurious ""Owners Suite"" onboard. We'll check out the dining, explore the marina and fully emerce ourselves in the world of Ritz Carlton. 

Unfortunately today’s ultra luxury cruise wasn’t quite as seamless as I’d hoped. In this video I’ll be breaking down exactly what happened and if I think you should try it for yourself. As always, I remain unbiased and honest in my reviews, this is no exception.

I started my channel to showcase the reality of what it's like to fly up front on airlines' premium products. This has now grown to share luxury rail and cruise content too. Unlike some channels i'll give you a REAL idea as to what it's like. No holding back and straight to the point. I have two main aims. 
[1] To entertain you with an exciting variety of luxury travel content. 
[2] Provide comprehensive / consistent reviews of First Class (in the sky, rails or sea); so you can make informed decisions when booking your next trip, be it for business or pleasure.

1161,kyS4Bhac0BM,President Biden HATED My Theme Park!,"President Joe Biden is visiting my theme park, Spy Ninjas HQ. The President of the United States is in Las Vegas for a variety of reasons including the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition. He would like to take a tour of our family entertainment center and if he gives it the Presidential Seal of Approval, he'll make sure a Spy Ninjas HQ is opened in every state, so everyone across America can get into a healthier lifestyle.

On the way to Spy Ninjas HQ, the President ran into some bad weather and is now delayed. We must start the tour via Facetime. Daniel walks POTUS through all the fun activities such as the trampoline park, ninja tag warrior course, climbing walls, zip line, ropes course, arcade, axe throwing, and more. Mr. Biden seems really concerned about the socks though. He makes Daniel take his shoes off and show his feet. The President is increasingly making the call awkward and uncomfortable. We're not sure if he's going to approve the opening of more locations.

1191,iwtSHXJUOFg,TAVARISH purchased the £2Million FLOODED McLaren P1,"#mclarenp1 #tavarish #flooded #supercars #p1flood #rebuild 

What is up everyone and welcome back to a brand new video! 2 Months ago I flew out to Florida with Petrolheadonism and Hardupgarage to check out @tavarish workshop and to film with Matt Armstrong who is also out there rebuilding a Porsche 992 GT3 in his garage, however Tavarish went a bit crazier than rebuilding just a GT3...

Back to last year and in September a massive hurricane hit Florida which caused huge floods with most cars around the area being damaged and swept away, and unfortunately that included this one week old newly brought McLaren P1 which costed around £2Million! but sadly this one literally got swept away, completely going under water and ending up 500metres down the road all damaged and likely to be heading to the scrap yard the next week...

That's until Tavarish has crazily brought the ""flooded"" P1 and which I think most people can say it will be by far the wildest automotive rebuilds, or at least supercars on YouTube.

Big thank you to Freddy for letting us come to his workshop and showing us around his P1 so we could make videos which you guys are seeing here, please go and show support on his channel and watch the first episode to this build here:

Like Lomedy and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft SMP. Like Parrot / ParrotX2 Lifesteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 12.240 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. I escaped this Minecraft prison like Omziiscool but not Parrot or Clownpierce or Spoke with 100+ / 2,193 Bedrock and TNT.  This stacked player stole my permanent hearts on the Lifesteal SMP. Like any other video mine such as I Started Minecraft's Greatest Business, or I Trained a Minecraft Frog to Kill People, are unscripted videos of mines! in this video I will be trying to upgrade Minecraft's Oldest Traps/ Old Traps such as Tree Traps, Door Traps, and Chest traps, ALL 3 BEING 8 YEARS OLD IN MINECRAFT/Xbox 360 Minecraft trolling but I'm also breaking this corrupted sever/ corrupted admin, dupping, breaking this PW2 (pay 2 wins) Minecraft server

The Subaru Impreza WRX STi S11 and S12 WRC generations featured a unique system dubbed Rocket Anti-Lag. Using patented technology from Prodrive and similar principles to a jet engine combustor, the cars were fitted with a separate combustion chamber in the exhaust.

The system that drivers like Petter Solberg and Mads Ostberg got to enjoy has puzzled people for some time, so I decided to read through the patent documentation and try to understand how it works. So let’s learn how anti-lag works, then go over all of the awesome engineering behind the rocket system! This is Subaru’s Rocket Anti-Lag explained!

1233,AMj5bIRqiLE,DEVASTATED Audi S6 5.2L V10 Engine Teardown. YOU CAN'T POWER THROUGH THAT! But Yet Here We Are.,"Please visit www.Importapart.com and peruse our inventory including our complete parts cars! If you don't see what you're looking for, fill out our part request form or email us at Importapartsales@gmail.com    
This is a teardown for the books! Some of you have seen this engine floating around in the background of previous teardown videos. I've been avoiding this one for a month or two, and have burned through all of my ""easy"" engines. Decided to rip the scab off, and get to this 5.2L BXA Audi V10 core that came in. I knew nothing about it. It was cheap, not a high risk engine. This was filmed over 3 different occasions, and required a lot of on the fly research to get it apart remotely correctly. I'm hardly an Audi or VW guy, and this is the first engine of this type I've ever torn down. 
The 5.2L BXA came in the Audi C6 S6 starting in 2007. They are rated 435hp and 398lbft of torque. Personally, they seem incredibly complex for the power they make however they do sound pretty amazing. This particular engine was pretty pooched. Whoever was behind the wheel when this happen tried to power through whatever the situation was, and it wasn't the right call and it likely cost them their car as it was junked after this. 

I really hope you enjoyed this teardown, it was a lot of fun to learn how it came apart both the right way and the wrong way. 
As always, I appreciate all of the comments, feedback and even the criticism. Catch you all on the next one!

WOW is all I can say. I have always wanted to get one of these engines on the channel but I NEVER imagined I would find one blown up in such spectacular fashion. This engine has been previously rebuilt but its days as anything other than scrap, are over. 
The 8L Magnum V10 was based on the 5.9L 360ci V8, which is based on the old LA small block Chrysler V8. Coming out for the 1994 model year, the 8.0L V10 made a LOT more power and torque than its Chevrolet and Ford big block competitors. 310hp and 450lb ft of torque made these things a monster in the 90's. This engine is NOT based on the Dodge Viper V10. Dodge continued production of these engines until the 2003 model year. 
Why am I doing this? I own and run a full service auto salvage business in the Saint Louis Missouri area, and part of our model includes buying cores and dismantling them to salvage the reusable parts for resale. We do not rebuild engines, merely supply parts to those that do. 

I really hope you enjoyed this teardown, it has been one of my favorites so far. As always I appreciate all of the comments, feedback and even the criticism.

1237,UPQFY3vug7M,I Put a CORVETTE Motor in My Brothers PORSCHE 911,"Go to https://buyraycon.com/scraplife for 15% off your order!

The Chevrolet Corvette Ls3 is one of the most popular motors of all time.  With a massive amount of motor swap vehicles built around the Corvette Ls3 platform.  It is easy to see why the Corvette Ls3 is such a popular choice once you work around them.

The Porsche 911 is one of the most famous and storied vehicles ever built.  The Porsche 911 comes in several variations including the very capable Porsche  911 Turbo models.  The Porsche 911s horizontally opposed 6 cylinder engine mounted in the rear is one of the most unique designs to come from the factory.

So, it only seems like a match made in heaven to combine the power and simplicity of the Corvette Ls3, and the timeless design of the Porsche 911.  When motor swapping a vehicle, nothing ever goes to plan.  Especially when working on a Porsche 911.  So, lets see how well this Corvette Ls3 v8 fits into the back of a Porsche 911 that was never designed for it!

New compressor had to be quieter, build air pressure much faster and to have a much drier air output. I had to Hydro test the tank along the way as well as building a water aftercooler to drastically lower the charge air temperature. Final result is a much a better compressor that builds crazy fast air pressure, puts out bone dry air and way quieter.

In televisione è stata una delle puntate più viste, a dimostrazione che gli italiani amano ancora la 127 come il primo giorno. Al di là dell'affetto per una macchina intramontabile, in questa puntata vedremo la seconda parte della trasformazione operata da Polini Motorsport e la prova finale, stavolta non in pista, ma su una strada di montagna chiusa al traffico, proprio sul percorso di una Prova Speciale rally.

La formula è semplice già dai primi video: non si chiacchiera troppo, non si ricorre a musichette improbabili e si lascia parlare le automobili. Il Drive Experience di Davide Cironi vuole ricordare quello che chi sapeva ha dimenticato e vuole far conoscere a chi non c'era quello che si è perso. Questo non vuol dire che si parli solo di passato, ma anzi, il programma si cura in egual modo anche del presente e del futuro. Si attinge dai grandi Vecchi e dalle loro storie perché possiamo noi prenderne spunto e continuare a far vivere il nostro amore per l'automobile sportiva. Infine ci sono loro, le macchine, con le infinite sfumature e anime, che Davide prova a farci assaporare dal sedile del passeggero. www.driveexperience.it",2013-06-04 10:32:38+00:00,3590.7590919063546,138210893,325,506000

Subscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7

The Lexus RZ 450e has a surprising amount in common with the Tesla Model S. They're both electric, they're both all-wheel-drive, and they both offer a steering yoke! Not surprising, Lexus doesn't want to call it a yoke, because Tesla's steering yoke got so much negative feedback upon it's release, and with good reason. Lexus has overcome the Tesla's flaws, however, with a clever new design: steer-by-wire. You see, there isn't anything physically connecting the steering wheel to the steering rack; all communication is electronic! 

Before you freak out, know that we'll deep dive into this technology in this video, answering the following five questions:
1) How does steer-by-wire work?
2) Why would you use steer-by-wire, and what are the advantages?
3) Can you trust steer-by-wire to be safe and reliable?
4) Why is Tesla's steering yoke a bad design?
5) What drawback's does Lexus steer-by-wire system have?

Enjoy the video!

I bought a used truck and the previous owner tried to hide a bent rim with a cheap thin layer of plastidip. Maybe 2 cans on all 4 wheels. I've struggled removing even good plastidip before and I stumbled upon a youtube video of a guy suggesting Kerosene. Wanted to try it out myself and also give others a second-hand review to prove whether or not it worked. I could not recommend this method more! Don't even waste your time doing anything else but this. I bought the Kerosene at my local Walmart for $8 a gallon. Only used 1 gallon for all 4 wheels and i really slapped it on there.

1252,gVudIIhyjt8,EVERTON 1-1 TOTTENHAM | Premier League highlights,"Another spirited display didn’t look to be enough when Abdoulaye Doucoue was shown a straight red card just before the hour mark for a shove on Harry Kane, before the England striker netted from the penalty spot minutes later after Keane has brought down Cristian Romero.

But Everton refused to give in. And after piling on the pressure despite the numerical disadvantage, a straight red card for substitute Lucas Moura for a late challenge on Keane two minutes from time offered a lifeline.

Keane then turned hero in dramatic fashion, smashing a superb 25-yard drive past Hugo Lloris to spark jubilant scenes around Goodison.

Sit back and enjoy as Carlo Ancelotti and his men defeated Real Valladolid courtesy of a top notch first half in which they scored four goals. The first was an early Rodrygo Goes goal after a pin-point Asensio assist, and then it was time for the Karim Benzema show. The Frenchman scored three goals in seven minutes, completing his hat trick with a brilliant bicycle kick. Marco Asensio crowned a top performance with a goal of his own in the second half and Lucas Vazquez made it six with a goal in extra time.

1270,1HIhb7A0xX4,The Equalizer | Robert Fights a Russian Gang (Denzel Washington),"Robert (Denzel Washington) walks in on an underground sex-trafficking operation and after his initial offer to shut down the operation is rejected, takes matters into his own hands.

Watch the full movie now! https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/The_Equalizer?id=vTQIRJzKdJo

McCall (Denzel Washington) has put his mysterious past behind him and is dedicated to living a new, quiet life. But when he meets Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can’t stand idly by. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer.
