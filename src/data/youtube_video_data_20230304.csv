LYRICS

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it’s yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiving misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it’s darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

LYRICS

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don’t recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide
 
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up
 
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well
 
Don’t ever speak my name
Remember you’re to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you’re left behind

And now you speak my name
You’ve given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don’t you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I’m exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I’m no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Anticipation
In domination 
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Full speed or nothing 
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation 
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing 

Lux Æterna 
Lux Æterna 

Lux Æterna

Emancipation 
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike 
Amplification 
Lightning the nation
Never alive more
Than right here tonight

Full speed or nothing

LYRICS

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it’s yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiving misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it’s darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich & Kirk Hammett

Theorists, what is McDonald's selling? The answer seems obvious - fast food! Most of us have partaken in their Big Mac burgers, fries, and other staples of the golden arches. Yet, that may be a big ol' LIE! That's right, Ronald McDonald may not be a clown selling some of our favorite indulgent quick serve foods. In fact, McDonald's may be in a completely different business all together. What is that business? You'll have to watch to find out!

I just talk about technology / inventions / gizmo / gadgets / innovations / whatever in this one. I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. 


This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)

This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. 

I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.

Stay safe ❤️ see you next video.

hi guys new video. this video is about super powers. a while ago i asked you on my community page if you had a super power what would it be
and this is some of the asnwers. there are a lot of good and creative super powers in the comments, and i sadly only covered like 4.
i want to do more of this, im thinking i could cover more of the comments in like a tier list kind of thing? maybe?
i'll let you know.
spiderman has nothing on these super powers. spiderman can jump. cool. try literally flying.
best super power you could ask for. actually there was a shape shifting power that i saw i liked a lot.
and if you shape shift you can just fly by being a bird. kind of op tbh.
well anyway, idk if you can tell i did some special saucy things in this video that will allow me to animate faster.
i will tell you what i did in a later video. i hope you guys like the way it looks.

It's a video that is wildly unorganized random thoughts about minecraft. I was kind of random about these minecraft thoughts but that is a okay in my opinion. I don't have a boss! You can't fire me! 
I maybe should have had more structure in here but I think I made some solid enough jokes where it can stand up on its own though :) sold out pretty hard this video though lol going to take a sponsorship break after this for a little while. I feel like you guys earned it.
There's a part in the video where I screen cap the suggested page and trending page and there's like TommyInnit and Jschlatt and JaidenAnimations in there so I guess you can see what the youtube algorithm wants me to watch. Very Pochamp.
Minecraft is the game I have played most and I love it so this video was more or less self indulgent for me. I hope it makes you laugh at least once.
I made a highschool presentation about minecraft and I got a good grade but probably only because the teacher felt sorry for me.
I love the cozy minecraft rain and listening to it inside my house. It is so comfortable.
The Allay is the new minecraft mob that won minecraft live vote! I voted for the Allay because he is more helpful even though the copper golem was really cute.

end of year post. This was a longer video which is all thanks to Matt! You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.

Anyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day. Either as a farmer or a tourist who knows.

I hope you enjoyed this video. More to come.

hello how's it going. This cartoon is done and now you are watching it. Isn't that wild? yes. I hope you like this one. It's about the times I played sports. I played basketball, baseball... I am just realizing right now that baseball is called base ball because you run around the bases... wow. I really just didn't know that this whole time. Anyway I also did skiing and track and field. I was bad at everything I did. I also talk about how I'm really bad at golf, but I am kind of thinking listening back to it that you kinda had to be there for that one. I think I've come a long way when it comes to making these videos but oof sometimes I just fall right on my face when it comes to telling stories. But it's all about improvement right? I'll just do better next time :)


I find that I am not really big into competitive stuff. Sports being one thing, but video games too. I like more casual games like minecraft. I used to be big into league of legends, but haven't played in years. It was so toxic, so now I just play block game :) and make block house.


thanks for watching ❤️ hope you liked it.

Yo wassup the video it is done. This video is about the time I had appendicitis and was sent to the hospital where I got emergency surgery. This video actually had a due date (today) for the sponsor so there was a couple things that got left out of the story, they were tiny details but it was things like my friends came to visit me after my surgery and it was really nice! It meant a lot more than I expected it to. My friends were the real stars here and I don't think I did them real justice tbh so maybe another day I'll do a retelling of the story, podcast style or something. I might take a break from sponsors for a video or 2 so I don't run into this problem again. Also I'm getting worried the sponsorship reads are just funnier than the actual video lol.


But yeah the appendicitis thing. It was terrible. Especially getting sick all over the place. I remember that doctor looking at me and being like ""you need to stick this tube in your stomach"" and I was thinking I wasn't ready but didn't really have a choice. There was no room for push back it was all or nothing. It was a little freaky but I think I'm so lucky to have my friends in my life to support me. They were there to bring me to the hospital, support me emotionally, take care of my belongings when I abandoned them in the classroom.


Also I learned a lot about the hospitalization process. It's pretty fast like I was just given a room right away. One moment I was given an assessment and the next I was given a patient robe to put on, I hardly had time to think!


TIME TO GET TO WORK ON THE NEXT VIDEO!

Here's the tier list:
https://tiermaker.com/create/door-854724

I'm an idiot and made the tier list to have an A+ instead of an S and didn't realize until I was almost done with the video but whatever the concept is the same. That website is kinda sketchy too for making a tier list. I wanted to make a tier list and it wanted me to sign up with a twitter account and requested ALL ACCESS to my twitter account. And there's no other website that lets you make tier lists so I just made a different twitter account so that I could make the tier list anyway. And it's only shady for making tier lists you can use tier lists for free without account access.



Also I am so tired cuz I needed to get this video done by literally today and I procrastinated a ton and stayed up really late to make sure it was finished. Idk why I do these things to myself. But it was a fun video so whatever! I always feel like I am worried about telling a story correctly and making sure it makes sense but for this I'm literally just ranking doors. No pressure at all. And that made it more enjoyable to make. I just need to get better about procrastination is all.

thanks for watching ❤️ hope you liked it.

I was late for posting this video and didn't finish until after the state fair ended :( but that's okay I wanted to post it anyway. I had a couple thoughts on state fair stuff and I made a video on those things. The state fair food primarily. Thank you to Jaiden to doing a little voice bit in the beginning there. It was literally one word but hey credit where credit is due.

The state fair has good food. I love it so much I was sad I couldn't go this year. There's corn dogs, cheese curds, french fries, cookies, milk and a ton more. There's a lot of other foods that I hate though but it's a big part of why people go in the first place. To each their own.

This video took longer to make because I was programming new tools to make the animation process easier. It was... kind of a weird thing to do. I hope it made the process faster but I didn't measure it so ..oops!

I'm going to try to post a couple more times before the year ends. It's been too sparse this year.

thank you for watching ❤️

OOOOHHHH 2 VIDEOS IN LESS THAN 28 DAYS????
HOW DID HE DO IT??? ˢˡᵉᵉᵖ ᵈᵉᵖʳᶦᵛᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ

This video was about a food fight I experienced back in jr high school. It was uneventful but eventful at the same time. More chaos than food fight if I'm honest. But you probably already know that because who reads the description before watching the video am I right.

It was a bad time because we got punished in an intense way, but it was also a good time because it was really crazy to be a part of. School isn't always that great so to be able to spice things up with U̴̡̧̕N̵̩̠̓́R̶̰̪̒Ė̶̘̟L̸̙̤̿E̸̜͖͌N̴̦̪̈́T̵͗̔͜Ĩ̷͙͊N̸͍̞̎G̴͉̯̊̑ ̶̣̈́D̷͉͐Ĕ̴̱͋S̸̨̰̿̋T̴̙̲̋R̵̮̩̐̓Ú̸͕̊C̴͇̹̓T̶̙̏̔ͅĬ̷̤Ô̵̡̰͘N̸̞̊ ̶̝̦͆́Â̵̮͚͋N̷͉̓D̷̳͉̏ ̷̡̿C̷̘̿H̵̘̖̐A̶̠̅O̷̧̓S̶͔̽ is a fun way to keep things interesting.

I also partnered with youtooz to create a little icecreamsandwich figurine. I talk about it at the end of the video. If you follow me outside of youtube you probably know that by know. It's exciting actually it turned out great. I hope you like it too!

Oh also I am starting another channel to put my short animations on. Usually I post them to tiktok or instagram or twitter but I think putting them on youtube. It might be the main home for them in the future. I'm still working on setting it up so things might change. 
Check it out here if you're in to that kind of thing: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6KVHFHpCwujbw2TfKnQ3uQ

101,6-T-Rsoq5a0,super dream,"I'm not superstitious at all. I really cannot explain this, and I sound like a crazy idiot but whatever. It's a story. It feels kind of cool that it happened though. This was on the SNES super mario world game if you wanna go check out the secret yourself. I will have to double check which castle it was in though. Might have been Lemmy's castle. If there's a snake block just follow it down the hole I promise it'll work.


Also my face is in this one. Kind of a face reveal if you want to put it that way. I was nervous about showing my face in my videos for the longest time but the longer I've had this channel the more I think it's more effort than it's worth. I mean I wasn't gaining anything by being hidden. So enjoy my ugly mug and long no-haircut-in-several-months hair. And my dice.


Sometimes I think about the origin of the universe and then I'm like ""but what came before THAT"" and it's kind of freaky. There's so much mystery in that it kind of makes you think like what else don't we know? Are psychic abilities really possible? Probably not, and even after my premonition dream I don't think any differently about superstitious stuff. But it's fun to think about what if it were real.


Do you guys still read these descriptions? I just kind of use it as a thought dump. bloo blah blee bla bloo blee



Anyway thanks for stopping by again. Love you all. Here's some links for merch and twitter. I hope you have a good day ❤️ you deserve it.

I am over the sickness now, but it was annoying to be sick out of nowhere and wanting to record, so I just made a video about getting sick. I'm very smart.

I have two more videos this year minimum so I hope you enjoy

103,s-MoeONH5Ug,difficulty eating new york pizza,"Thanks to Keeps for sponsoring this video! Head to https://keeps.com/icecreamsandwich to learn more and get 50% off your first order of Keeps. 

i went to new york, and had pizza in new york. the experience was really fun. i saw a lot of stuff and ate a lot of food but the highlight of the journey was the pizza from some random pizza joint. it was a really interesting experience because in the midwest everything is calm and spread out, in new york (and this was the first time ive been in new york) it's all dense and active! i really liked it i wish i could be there more tbh.

i actually had a lot more to say in this video, but i cut it down because i ran out of time and needed to post today for CONTRACT REASONS which is not fun or preferable. I have been working on posting more but somehow always always always run up against some deadline. I am going to implement a new strategy where I am making a little bit of content every day instead of planning a ton and then making a lot of content all at once. idk what's the solution, but hopefully this workflow will be better for me. I just want to very casually make a video and be like ""hey i was in ny had pizza was a good time"" or ""hey i did this thing here's what happened funny jokes bla bla bla"" and not have it be once every one or two months. idk im just venting at this point. just know that i really appreciate you checking out the video even though my posts are super spotty, it's really helpful.

thank you for watching as always ❤️

From quality content to meme-able garbage, from scary games to full-on interactive movies you'll find it all. You will, actually. I have over 5000 videos so I'm sure there's something you'd like. 

Maybe you like horror games, or funny games, or comedy sketches, or animations, or compilations, or reactions, or reviews, or challenges, or cryptic lore, or mind-crippling ennui, or stuff-that-is-guaranteed-to-probably-make-you-cry? Whatever you're into I'm sure there's something for you down in the briny deep of my video page. So why not dive in?

Or don't. Life is yours to choose after all.

YOUR COMMENTS
-Some redditors brought up the fact that Aldrich could have been dreaming of Priscilla - not Yorshka. I definitely should have mentioned this as a possibility, though I personally think it's more likely that he's dreaming of Yorshka - who fits the description as a ""young, pale girl in hiding"" and has a relationship to Gwndolin, who Aldrich is dreaming through. 

-Also apparently the Japanese text for divine blessing COMPARES gwynevere to the queen. The english text seems to imply that Gwynevere IS the queen. The more you know. 


MY EXTRA THOUGHTS
-The pontiff blades are described as being eaten away by insects, maybe the same insects that are found in the deep. 

-I could have done a better job making it clear at the start that Gundyr is IMPLIED to have met the firekeeper who never met her champion. It's never explicitly stated.

-The fire linking curse that lothric and lorian are afflicted by could be referring to the fact that people, souls and lands are forced together and ""twisted"" in order for someone to come along and link the fire. I have a lot to say about lothric / lorian in the next video

-The candles in the cathedral of the deep look a bit like the ""lake"" symbols from bloodborne, but maybe i'm reaching a bit..

-Sorry this video was so late. Currently in the stressful process of moving, and life got in the way a bit this month.



EXTRA THEORIES (coming soon - have to clean up the script)

►Alex Roe - Demon's Souls - Let Strength Be Granted
►34 Nashandra (Dark Souls 2 OST)


PREPARE TO WHY
I think the story I've built will be a good framework for future theorycrafting, but even after this, you should still have questions. I only went into storylines related to the ending, but there are definitely unexplained parts of the story that I left out because I can't find definitive answers.

1. The opening cutscene. Where are we in the opening cutscene, with this tree and the kingdom reflected in the water? Also, WHEN are we, if she's referring to Drangleic in the past tense?

2. Who are the giants?

3. What did King Vendrick steal?

4. Why does the giant lord give you the giant's kinship? Why do we need the giant's kinship to open the throne?

5. Why does the emerald herald say we're breaking the shackles of fate, when we're clearly adhering to fate by linking the fire all over again? Is she referring to how we're breaking the shackles of the undead curse?
 
7. Why does Nashandra just wait at the throne to be challenged over and over again? Nashandra guided you to the throne, presumably so you can open it for her - but it's not like she is capable of taking the giant's kinship from you once you're defeated. Kinship isn't a physical thing. Does she want you to get inside the throne, or not? I can't help but feel like there's something missing here.

8. The Herald seems to be freed of her purpose..but there's a final twist.

She is the one who brought you to Drangleic.

9. As a final note, do you think linking the flame is done at the far fire when you start New Game Plus, or in the kiln?

Kai Cenat (aka @KaiCenatLive) soon to be the the world’s most subscribed to steamer on Twitch, but up until now he still is in an unfinished room. To take his subathon (aka MAFIAthon) to the next level, I decided to surprise him with his dream steaming setup! This was absolutely insane to make becuase we only had one day to make it happen. To distract Kai for the day, we sent him to Universal Studios with an all access pass and he had a blast. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! Kai loved his new Spiderman gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Thanks to the @Switchbacksfc for hosting us! 

As soon as I heard that iShowSpeed’s birthday was coming up I knew that I had to be a part of it! That’s why I was stoked when Adin Ross reached out and asked if I could build him a custom Cristiano Ronaldo statue to surprise Speed with for his birthday livestream! You see, I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), but I've never built something made of triangles. The Beem Team and I decided to take things over the top for this by making the statue life size and wearing the uniform from the 2022 World Cup. To top things off, we only had 7 days to build it because everything is always last minute. After doing 20 hour days, we got barely got it done in time and had to deliver it accross the country to California. Both iShowSpeed and Adin Ross were AMAZED at how good the statue turned out turned out! This build was a real struggle to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

I have always hated scary movies but have history of going to some of the scariest places in the world such as I Survived the Worlds Scariest Clown Motel and Overnight in the World's Most Haunted Hotel, but this time we are taking things to a whole new level by staying Overnight in the REAL Conjuring House. I was inspired to do this after seeing Sam and Colby’s video on the Conjuring House and not believeing that it was real, but man was I wrong. The Conjuring House was by far the scariest place I’ve ever been and the paranormal and ghost activity there was unreal. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

I’ve always been amazed by illusions and science experiments that make the impossible possible. That’s why when I saw my friends Ben Azelart and Stokes Twins doing videos to bust 100 myths in 24 hours or break 100 rules in 24 hours, I got the idea to do 100 science experiments in 24 hours! These experiments were way harder to do than I expected. Countless failures on mulitple of the experiments, but I’m so proud we were able to make everything happen. We may also be the first person to do 3 different elephant toothpaste experiments in one video! Not to mention the world’s largest paper machet volcano, turning an aluminum can to plastic, and sending G Fuel to space! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

MrBeast just hit 100 million subscribers so to celebrate I decided to build Jimmy Donaldson a replica of his red diamond play button, but 100 times bigger! In order to make things perfect, I secretly sunk into his massive warehouse and took a 3d scan of the play button. Then me and the Beem Team scaled it up and made it massive. We even had to call in special helper Uncle Dave to teach us to weld! In the end MrBeast was stoked with out it turned out and I couldn’t be happier. Now Jimmy will have to find somewhere to put it lol.  This was an insanely stressful and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching! I really appreciate your support! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

After being humbled by the worlds most expensive airplane seat, I decided to travel across the world to Thailand to experience the World’s Cheapest 5-Star Hotel. This journey took us 36 hours to travel from Denver to Phuket, Thailand for one of the best experiences of my life. Not only did this room have multiple living spaces, but it also had my own private pool and a 5-star dining experience. To top things off I hiked to a massive Budda statue, went on a boat tour to the most beautiful islands in the world, even got to swim with elephants! This whole trip was absolutely amazing and I can’t wait to go back to Thailand. This experience was insane and super amazing to make, but we also had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Ever since I was little I've dreamed of being a superhero, but I - like many of you - was not lucky enough to be blessed with superhuman athletic ability. So in this video I finally live our my childhood dreams by fighting alongside 50 Spidermen. Unexpectedly, Big Matt got taken by a super villain and I had to train to become a full fledged superhero to get him back. My friend @zealous served as my mentor until I was ready to take down the evil villain. This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way.

I used to love to watch SpongeBob Squarepants growing up so I felt that it was only fitting that I built the world's largest real life Bikini Bottom in my backyard including a pineapple house for SpongeBob, rock dome for Patrick Star, and Stonehenge house for Squidward Tentacles in a previous video. However, I never got around to building the Chum Bucket so that’s exactly what I’m doing in this video! You might know that there is a real life golden SpongeBob house in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, but it costs $3,800 to stay PER NIGHT and no one can afford that so the next best option was to build a realy life Bikini Bottom in my backyard. This video was super nostalgic to make and we had a lot of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and I can't wait for you to see what's happening next Tuesday.

Ever since I was a kid I’ve been a gamer, but lately it has been hard to find the time. I also may or may not still live with my mom so I feel guilty gaming while at home. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under the stairs in a hidden closet so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom didn’t find out about this project, I sent her and my sister to Paris for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Ever since I was little, I’ve been obsessed with Spider-Man and have always wondered what it would be like to be him. I’ve gone to great lengths to find out what it is like – from hiring 50 Spider-Man to training like Spiderman for 24 hours. Unfortunately, I just didn’t have the skills to cut it in the real world. That why when I saw Ryan Trahan’s videos titled “I Spent 100 Days in the Metaverse” and “I Spent 100 Days in Grand Theft Auto” I knew I had to try out being Spider-Man in VR! Only problem was that I have never used virtual reality before, so this was quite the learning curve. Once I got in the game I learned that it is really easy to do epic GTA 5 ragdolls as Spiderman and it’s very hard to actually use powers for good. I also found out that Venom was wreaking havoc and needed to be stopped. Therefore, I had to train up my Spiderman skills to defeat Venom and save the town! This was insane and super intense to make, but I had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

Since November 2022, Russia has been releasing water from the Kakhovka Dam, thereby draining the reservoir behind it. This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north. But it also hints at the possibility that Russia is running low on soldiers, otherwise Moscow would not be willing to incur these costs.

On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. One of the principal targets was Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Most outside observers, including U.S. intelligence, believed that the political center of would fall quickly. But as the hours turned to days, and the days turned to weeks, Ukraine proved that Kyiv would not fall so easily.

But the story of how Kyiv survived is complicated. A combination of Russian miscalculations and clever Ukrainian strategy made the difference. The dreaded 64-kilometer Russian Kyiv convoy fell apart, giving Ukraine a fighting chance for the rest of the war. This is the story of the Battle of Kyiv.

Why did Russia miscalculate so badly in its invasion of Ukraine? The answer is more than two decades in the making. Putin's Persistent and intentional decay of Russia's institutions made it impossible for Russia's intelligence community and military to provide quality information to him. Facing the uncertainty---and wagering that it would take a true disaster for it have a deep effect on him personally---Putin pulled the trigger.

Retaking Crimea has long been the goal for Ukraine. But why does Ukraine seem optimistic about its chances? The way that Russia has fought the war so far suggests that its position in Crimea is weaker than it might seem.

It is 8 am on February 24, 2022. Although no one in Ukraine realizes it yet, what is about to unfold in a relatively unassuming part of the country will be arguably the single most important event in Ukrainian history. The stakes could not be higher: the country itself is on the line. This is story of the Battle of Hostomel Airport.

Thus far, neither Ukraine nor Russia has made much progress during the winter. What is actually going on? This video surveys four possibilities. On one extreme, Ukraine may be trapping Russia into attacking at high losses with few gains. On the other extreme, Russia may be engaging in a true counter-counterattack, and Ukraine will soon be put on its backfoot. We may also just be observing winter or a true stalemate.

Although we are still many steps away from serious nuclear problems, the groundwork for concerns has been laid. This video explains what tactical nuclear weapons do, how Russia might try to deploy them, and what might deter Putin from taking such steps.

There is this idea floating around that what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. That surviving a disease leaves you better off. And it seems to make sense because we have all experienced  this. When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult situation in the future. But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 
So, what happens when you get sick?

You are cells. Your muscles, organs, skin and hair. They are in your blood and in your bones.
Cells are biological robots. They don’t want anything, they don’t feel anything. They are never sad or happy. They just are, right here, right now. They are as conscious as a stone or a chair or a neutron star. Cells just follow their programming that has been evolving and changing for billions of years, molded by natural selection. 
They are impossible machines and yet, here they are, driven entirely by the fundamental forces of the universe. The smallest unit of life, right at the border where physics becomes biology. 
Sometimes, to get a truer understanding of how amazing something is, you need to hold your breath and dive in really  deep. So, what are cells and how do they work?

The Brain Eating Amoeba
A war has been going on for billions of years that breeds well armed monsters who struggle with other monsters for survival. Having no particular interest in us, most of them are relatively harmless, as our immune systems deal with their weapons handily. But there are exceptions. 
Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba that not only has developed a deadly taste for human brains but is also a match for our defenses and a guest in dramatic headlines. What happens when this monster enters your body?

If you are like most people, there is a gap between the person you are and the person you wish to be. There are little things you think you should do and big things you ought to achieve.
From working out regularly, eating healthy, learning a language, working on your novel, reading more or simply actually doing your hobby instead of browsing reddit.
But it can seem that to achieve your goals, you have to become a different person. Someone who is consistent, puts in more effort, has discipline and willpower. Maybe you have tried your hardest to be like that. And it worked! For a while. Until you find yourself slipping back into your old ways. In the end, you always seem to fail. And with every failed attempt, you become more and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. 
If you believe “success and hustle” internet, it is all your own fault: if you don't succeed, you just didn’t want it enough and the failure is all you. But change is actually hard. But as with most things in life, understanding why makes things easier.

The future of humanity seems insecure. Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight. But humans always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. 
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants. What makes this worse is that we actually may live at an extremely critical moment in human history. To understand why, let us look at the temporal window of humanity and ask:
When will the last human be born and how many people will there ever be?

When we think about alien civilizations we tend to look into the vastness of space, to far away planets. But there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be giving too little thought to: time.
Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years, other civilizations existed on earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out? And that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet? What does science have to say about this and what are the implications for us?

The Earth is a gigantic ball of semi-molten rock, with a heart of iron as hot as the surface of the Sun. Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up. Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface. Earth’s crust is the only thing in their way. It feels solid to us, but it is only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth. True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined, subjecting the climate to centuries  worth of change in a single year, while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases: supervolcanoes. How big can they get? And will they put an end to humanity?

In the 1970s thousands of Chickenheads rained from the sky in Europe, making foxes and other wildlife confused and very happy. Why? They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity – since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all. 
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage, and has been haunting us for at least 4000 years. It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water. But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is, but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses.

At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 30 % of the world’s population, and in many ways the pinnacle of human advancement. Rome became the first city in history to reach one million inhabitants and was a center of technological, legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible to topple, stable and rich and powerful.
Until it wasn’t anymore. First slowly then suddenly, the most powerful civilization on earth collapsed. If this is how it has been over the ages, what about us today? Will we lose our industrial technology, and with that our greatest achievements, from one dollar pizza to smartphones or laser eye surgery? Will all this go away too?

The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions of stars and planets and in the middle of it all there is earth, with you and us. 
But as enormous as the universe seems looking up, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are towering over worlds within worlds, within worlds – each in plain sight and yet hidden from your experience.
Let’s go on a journey – we’ll start in a park, about a thousand meters long, enough for a 15 minute walk. Every time we click a magic button, we’ll become a thousand times smaller.  Ready? Let’s go.

Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes. Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy. But it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it.

Climate Change is just too much. There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless. 

We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it  so hard to just stop emitting these gases?

Friends make life good. They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun. They give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness. Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.

But maybe you have scrolled through your phone, unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with or ask for comfort. You may realize that you don’t have enough friends and feel lonely. And it is not just you. Disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread. 

Many people want more close friends but don’t know how to get them.

Black hole stars may have been the largest stars to ever exist. They burned brighter than galaxies and were Larger than any star today or that could ever exist in the future. But besides their scale, what makes them special and weird is that deep inside, they were occupied by a cosmic parasite, an endlessly hungry black hole. How is that even possible?

Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions. But… where is all of that? While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up. 

In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it. If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left. In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning. Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.

But let us go back to the beginning…

In and out, in and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells you are breathing.
Breathing is an answer to a very hard problem: How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive, from the outside, to the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem and the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life: Size.

Un Amor Como Este

Jálese compa Luis R Conriquez¡
Y Puro Grupo Firme! Pariente
Ahí te va, chiquita batallosa

Me vas a extrañar
Olvidarme no está tan pelada
No son enchiladas dejar de pensar en mi
Me vas a extrañar
Te aseguro que vas a buscarme
Yo aquí voy a esperarte
¿Quién soy yo pa decir que no?
Y es que los besos en tu boca saben mejor
Sabes que eres mía y yo tuyo
Solo que estás enojada
Ven yo te contento y pronto se te pasa
Yo aquí estoy tranquilo
Te doy chanza que te vayas y lo pienses
Y verás que no hay un amor como este
Porque solo yo, porque solo yo sé como quererte 

Sabes que eres mía y yo tuyo
Solo que estás enojada
Ven yo te contento y pronto se te pasa
Yo aquí estoy tranquilo
Te doy chanza que te vayas y lo pienses
Y verás que no hay un amor como este
Porque solo yo, porque solo yo sé como quererte

Letra 
Es muy fácil dar tu opinión
Sin estar en mis zapatos
Hace rato que no, 
que no tenemos un trato

Para ti es muy fácil decir
Que ya pasó y que lo superé
Que fue un simple amor
Que a los recuerdos ni me aferré

Para mí fuiste más que un simple amor
Fuiste el pasado que jamás regresó
Hoy me cuesta soltarte
Te amé como a nadie
El terco aquí es mi corazón
Si en tu vida prioridad nunca fui yo
¿Qué hago?

¿Y ahora, como le digo a mi corazón?
Que ya no puedo con esto
Me quema por dentro
Aquí ya no mando yo
No hay solución
Tú te ves muy feliz
Yo no hallo la puerta
Y aún sigo pensando en ti

¿Y ahora, como le digo a mi corazón?
Que solo fuimos tu juego
Que nada en tu vida significo
El que falló fui yo
Por exponerlo sin pensar las consecuencias
Que a veces tiene el amor

(¡Y puro Grupo Firme!)

¿Y ahora, como le digo a mi corazón?
Que ya no puedo con esto
Me quema por dentro
Aquí ya no mando yo
No hay solución
Tú te ves muy feliz
Yo no hallo la puerta
Y aún sigo pensando en ti

¿Y ahora como le digo a mi corazón?
Que solo fuimos tu juego
Que nada en tu vida significo
El que falló fui yo
Por exponerlo sin pensar las consecuencias
Que a veces tiene el amor

VIDEO INFO
Howdy friends! In this video, we begin our deep dive into the wonderful and imaginative world of Graham Hancock, journalist, sociologist, pseudoscientist, and pyramid enthusiast. In his most recent documentary series on Netflix, Hancock postulates the existence of an ancient lost civilization that dominated the world at the end of the last ice age. Throughout this series I will be taking a balanced look at this claim, weighing each piece of evidence presented, in an attempt to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence for it.

ADDENDUM: At 48:00 I mistakenly class the Zigurrat at Ur as a burial structure. In reality, the Ziggurat was a temple to the Goddess of the moon. In research I got this crossed with the Royal Cemetary at Ur. Thank you to all who caught this miscategorization.

A Deep Dive into the Cerutti Mastodon Site,"In this video we take a dive into the mysterious archaeological site known as the Cerutti Mastodon. This site in Southern California dates back a shocking 130,000 years, nearly 100,000 years older than the next oldest evidence of human habitation of the Americas. By this point there is no archaeological evidence that Homo Sapiens had migrated out of Africa yet. Is it possible that Homo Sapiens were not the first human to make it across the Bering Land Bridge and into the lush forests of Pleistocene North America? Come along as we explore the intricacies of one of the most hotly debated archaeological sites in the country and the site of the mysterious Cerutti mastadon.

VIDEO INFO:
In this video we delve into the world we live in as seen through the eyes of a historian from 1855. We will see all sorts of views that have aged about as poorly as a view can, from the conquest and colonization of North America to the decimation of Indigenous populations. While the views are abhorrent by todays standards, it gives us a perfect opportunity to see how far we have come, how far we have yet to go, and how to crack a couple jokes along the way.

I'd like to give a huge thank you to Factor for sponsoring this video! Use code POGMMMNOV60 for 60% off your first box at https://strms.net/MiniminutemanFactorNovemberYT60 #ad 

Video Info:
In this video we make a rock sling to sling rocks. Many rocks and slings are slung as we explore this ancient and archaic piece of ranged weaponry. While the history of this ancient device is contested, we know it dates back at least to the ancient Fertile Crescent and is likely to have been invented far before that but due to being made of natural fibers left no surviving evidence. Here I will teach you how to make a rock sling of your own as well as let you experience the horror that is learning to use one for yourself.

VIDEO INFO:
Howdy Friends! In this video we spend an afternoon exploring the ancient shores of Lake Champlain in the state of Vermont. Our adventure brings us to Isle La Mott, a small island just north of the city of Burlington, which contains remnants of the Chazy Fossil Reef. Registered as a National National Landmark in 2009, the Chazy Fossil Reef is the oldest fossil reef in the world dating back more than 450 million years. It contains the fossilized remains of bivalves, corals and other ancient marine life that once lived in the warm shallow seas of Ordovician earth. We also discuss the Pleistocene glacial history of Lake Champlain from the Champlain Sea to the way that indigenous groups likely survived in this environment. Come along with me as we take a 450 million year walk down memory lane.

Howdy friends,
In this video I discuss Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark with John X Smith and 1UPWHATUP on the Movie Rant Break podcast. We obviously get highly tangential so you will get to see a wonderful sampling of talking about all kinds of conspiracies, archaeological theories and practices as well as getting to the core of why conspiracy sells. Id like to thank each and every one of you for watching this slightly different video and I hope you enjoy.

Id like to give a HUGE thank you to AkariKuzu for helping me search for the conspiracy videos which I review in this episode.

I also want to thank my incredible mods, GeorgeTheBarbarian, Deus, Gizmo, Thesaurus Rex, Aidan, Charli, Raven, Liekki, Callisto, Proserpina, Paperflesh and Regina George

In this video we go down the rabbit hole of the conspiracies surrounding the Dendera Light motif at the temple of Hathor at Dendera. From ancient aliens to Norwegian electricians this story is a roller coaster. Join me for the ride as I debunk it all.

Alex inspired this episode with his amazing Batfish footage. He just launched his channel in earnest - go and sub!

Barrett Christie 
https://www.maritimeaquarium.org/
Barrett shared his knowledge with me, and is an expert on fish husbandry. His spawning footage is very rare and shows that batfish spawn in a similar way to some other anglerfish.

LiquidGuru is a pro. Just gets such beautiful views into Aquatic life! His juvenile Orbicular Batfish is so well done.

Raymond Powers

There is also a wonderful resource on Mudskippers at http://www.themudskipper.org/
run by Gianluca Polgar, who was kind enough to point out two mistakes i made in this video:
 - At min 1.43-1.49: that is a blenny of the genus Andamia, not a mudskipper.
 - Not all mudskippers have fused pelvic fins that are used as suckers

Aside from calling a dolphin a fish - which i actually find kind of funny in context :)

I hired 10 Pokemon Shiny Hunters to catch me as MANY Shiny Pokemon as they could in a 6 hour time period. For every shiny pokemon they caught, they got $50. I will be giving all of these shiny pokemon away through Wonder Trade on a Livestream here on this channel! If you miss the stream, don't worry it will be made into a video.

update from jack: Hey everyone! I got to spend a lot of December and January travelling around the world and coming up with the video i really want to make this year. Our calendar is STACKED, and i really hope you enjoy the upcoming videos as much as i do :)

The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! 

Today I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! 

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience.

Effectively we are going to build The City of London 2. As you can tell this is not going to be your standard simcity city builder experience but rather a montage of exploiting cities skylines to break the new dlc and allow us to create the most profitable city possible with basically no effort. Now we have seen RT Game destroy cities with his powers as a mayor but I am a pro player when it comes to sim city and city building in general so get ready to watch as the spiffing brit beats all other records by using bugs and exploits to win. 

The following was written by an Ai because I think its funny:
In this video, I show you how I exploit the suffering of my city in Cities Skylines to make infinite money. I show you the in-game mechanics I use to do this, and how you can do the same.If you're a city builder or city planner, this is a must-watch video! I show you how I use game mechanics to exploit the suffering of my city, and how you can do the same in your own city. I also reveal some tips on how to make the most of your city, and how to make money playing city builder or city planner games!

Hello there ladies and gentlemen today something magical is about to happen today in todays video! The Spiffing Brit today attempts to play the 2008 classical game that is Spore. A game so unique that it took miracle video game god Will Wright to create a perfect game that inspired a generation of gamers before the release of minecraft. Welcome to Spore! Spore is a evolution game where you start as a single cell object and as you eat, you gain DNA and abilities! The only issue is today we will be seeing if you can beat spore by creating a religion of tea fanatics that can convert planets instantly thanks to a spore exploit! This will allow us to ally with the grox the main villains of spore. It will once and for all prove that spore is a perfectly balanced game which can for some reason be beaten by bypassing the core gameplay loop of designing planets to slowly produce spice and setting up trade routes. And for some reason we are able to go from cell stage to creature stage to tribal stage to civilization stage and finally the space stage and find that the space stage is now very funny to play!  

So today we will ally the grox everyones favourite spore cyborg creators of warcrimes! Whilst IGN might rate this gameplay poorly I however love the memes that can be created with a perfectly balanced spore glitch! 

What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. So reject your ign memes and get ready for some insane gameplay from anything from vic 3 to broken skyrim mods.

How much money can an economist make whilst playing as little of FFXIV as possible! Is it possible to sell a 1 gil fish for 1000 gil? Can you scam an entire data centre into buying milk at 3X the regular price? And why does the spiffing brit keep hoarding thavnarian chai tea! Is the economy of ff14 perfectly balanced or is a basic understanding of supply and demand economics necessary to make millions without even understanding or playing the game! So join me just in time for a newfound adventure bringing new free company houses that will require stupid amounts of gil to buy! Luckily using economics we have found a way to get Infinite Money! So lets dive into a world of Final Fantasy xiv and ride off the endwalker hype and the fans asmongold managed to bring into the game! 

so it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite money. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my economic strategy and tips and tricks that exist for us exploiters in this FFXIV 2022 Experience!

422,9lCNCiqSNYs,EVERYTHING IS BROKEN - Age Of Empires 3: Definitive Edition Is A Perfectly Balanced Game W/ Exploits,"aoe 3 definitive edition has just released on steam making it the latest real time strategy game to be released. Now what does the spiffing brit do with brand new rts games well he finds exploits in their perfectly balanced game design however this time EVERYTHING IS BROKEN! As the AI does not even function when given the challenge of moving across water. Age of empires has always been at the forefront of AI design in strategy games however for some reason Age Of Empires 3: Definitive Edition a 2020 strategy game has been released with AI reminiscent of an early 2000s strategy game. So naturally we will be seeing if Age Of Empires 3: Definitive Edition Is A Perfectly Balanced Game Without exploits or if perhaps the fact EVERYTHING is broken might upset the perfect game balance necessary in any top strategy game of 2020. I really hope that ahead of age of empires 4 we can get a bit of a magical rework of the AI to get a good challenge out of it on all the map types!

423,cnN00ppui-w,SPIFF Vs God - Civilization 6 Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits,"Welcome To The Impossible Civ 6 Game where I create the ultimate apocalypse mode where there is constant wildfires, earthquakes, meteors, floods and city destroying comets. Have you ever tried to settle a city but cant because your settlers instantly burst into flames as soon as they step out of your city? What about trying to do a civ war but your entire army just stood on top of the worlds largest earthquake. The result is a perfectly balanced game. This is without a doubt the most hostile and dangerous civ world I have ever created so why not give it a go! 

Today the game is going to become a hardcore and impossible game so no amount of infinite gold and science exploits that are overpowered and break the game will ultimately make a difference when everything you build can be burnt down each turn! So sure you can do your civ 6 deity challenge with the new civ 6 leader pass or instead you could survive the impossible game!

424,EBF3A3djMTQ,I Made The Worlds Fastest Kettle* -- (Yorkshire Tea Paid Me For It),"The time has finally come for The Spiffing Brit to destroy the world by creating the Worlds Fastest Kettle! Today I transform my boring useless performance sports car into a superior High speed tea brewing device! Normal kettles can boil water in 120 seconds this kettle can go 60 mph in just 3 seconds! Did I mention that todays video is also sponsored by YORKSHIRE TEA! That is right they actually decided to pay me to wrap my car and convert it into a high speed tea brewing machine! They even gave me access to little urn the mobile tea brewing truck to do a drag race and see which mobile kettle is the fastest! 

I honestly cannot believe that I the greatest tea drinker in the world now gets the opportunity to break my own made up world records and speedrun the tea brewing process by modding my car into well a kettle! This isnt a normal tea review this is me creating the fastest car (in terms of brewing a british tea) without having any mechanical experience or skills to do it! This car went from a boring tetley tea to an enlightened yorkshire gold that could destroy a guiness world record speedrun if it even existed! Funny It truly is perfectly Balanced.

*Excluding all the other fastest kettles...

Welcome back to cyberpunk 2077 where 2 years after release I have decided to return to the game! 2 Years later the game of cyberpunk has seen many patches and hot fixes as well as new content! Well I say new content. Most of it is features that were promised to be added into the release however were just some classic todd howard fabrications. So naturally 2 years on the game should have no bugs or glitches! So much to my surprise no this game is absolutely rammed with issues, exploits and glitches that plague all versions of this game. There are still infinite health glitches that create god mode. There are infinite money exploits that allow you to fabricate easily a million euro dollars. With overpowered quick hacks you can 1 hit entire armies of troops with digital plagues. There is still no balance to this game and it is still absurdly easy to break it. Becoming overpowered is easy but becoming a true god and breaking this game is not! So today I decided to become a god and break the games files to truly perfectly balance this game and see just how broken cyberpunk can get 2 years after release. 
Now after the release of cyberpunk edgerunners more and more people will dive into the world of cyberpunk 2077 exploit discovery!

427,hX_qyf38X9c,Can I Survive 100 Days in Hardcore Survival Mode? - Perfectly Balanced Skyrim Challenge #Attempt2,"Welcome back to skyrim! Where today we set out on a second attempt of an impossible challenge! Can you beat the survive 100 days in skyrim hardcore challenge? The rules are simple, Legendary difficulty skyrim with survival mode but the added twist that you are not allowed to equip any Armor or weapons. This is the hardest possible challenge skyrim can offer. You are effectively playing at 1 hp and almost anything will kill you and fail the run. Ontop of that in survival mode you must eat and sleep similarly to an indie survival game. You must also balance temperatures which in the cold northern lands of skyrim is rather impossible. 

Mod Pack Used: https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/jqd9zz

So sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or surviving 100 days of skyrim hardcore is a task that is simply too impossible for this pro exploiter!

The Developers have given me early access to the latest dlc Northern Lords game to record this gameplay footage and show off my favourite features in the game! We will be following the life of the count of the isle of man The dread pirate Captain Jock Sparrow who will be making money by Raiding the entire planet and world of ck3! By doing so we will become a legendary pirate and viking raider who will have infinite prestige and money! So sit back and enjoy this Pirate simulator which has been disguised under the name of a grand strategy game CK3! I loved playing CK2 and I am excited to be able to show off this next in CK3! But is this new game Crusader Kings 3 a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or is making money by Raiding so quickly I teleport overpowered! Well lets see what The Spiffing Brit has to show us today in Crusader Kings III 

So sit back and watch as the spiffing brit tests to see if Crusader Kings III is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if the Becoming a pirate Challenge is broken!! How can you even Become  Famous and prestigious in CK3 without doing any big achievement beyond raiding the entire world! What strange Strategy game exploit is this! Also featuring an Unlimited gold thanks to a gold exploit!

This video game exploit video will be jam packed with a best bits funny moments montage style of editing similar to that of Valefisk, Robbaz and RTgame. So sit back relax and grab a cup of tea to enjoy with the spiffing brit!

In the third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them to finish last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.

Where the power of technique and theory align. Located at the intersection of education and entertainment. 

I created this channel to impart the secret powers of shred guitar mastery. Within the annuls of my page, you'll find a vast catalogue of instructional material on Sweep Picking, Alternate Picking, Finger Tapping, Legato and Music Theory.

Now I like to have a good time when blowing up some licks. As a result, below the belt comedy and beer drinking may ensue at random. I believe there is untapped musical brilliance waiting to be revealed in you. Grab your axe and seize your shredmaster potential.

CRADLE OF FILTH mastermind Dani Filth says about the track:
""This track and the other original track on this album, 'Demon Prince Regent’, were both written after the recording of Existence Is Futile and present a perfect, but not necessarily related, bridge between our Nuclear Blast days and the forthcoming album on Napalm Records. It was always intended to be a double album, so we just thought, ‘f**k it! Let’s cram some original material on there as well! The absolute worst of both worlds! 
The song itself is about the epitome of burning passion; the dark inspiration of love and the creature that has ignited it.""",2023-03-01 15:00:04+00:00,14.875654274444447,1,Napalm Records,UCG7AaCh_CiG6pq_rRDNw72A,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fGrxKLsgidg/default.jpg,120,90,348,hd,false,89456,8083,0,506,"What started out as a one-person operation in a cramped living-room, became one of the biggest record labels of the independent scene.

LYRICS:
Ride, take a ride
On the Tekkno train right now, take your seat
Open up, feel the pounding bass deep inside ya

Shaky, shaky, sweaty ,sweaty
You make my spaghetti ready
Heat up the sauce, it's a dinner for one

You better hold on tight
'Cause we're rolling again
Through the wet lands down where the nature is plain
And when it's getting messy I'm taking the blame
'Cause I need you to stay on my Tekkno train

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

Destination, love
P-p-pleasure up above
You really can't stop the heat
I got lipstick on my feet, uh

Licky, licky, sucky, sucky
Yeah, you make my lolly poppy
Candy time, go get your dinner for one

You better go stuff your face
Before it's too late
'Cause they're standing in line
To have a piece of the cake
And when the feast is over, you'll see us again
Next week, same time on the Tekkno train

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

Your attention please
The 69 EC service Tekkno train on platform A-M-P and V
To Climax City is arriving ahead of schedule
We're sorry for any lost enjoyment

I'm gonna take it right now, hand it over
This ride is free but I really need to feel it now
Hand it over
Boom, boom, pow, there you go

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo
We're riding on the Tekkno train 

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo
We're riding out of town

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what

There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

The inspiration behind this video: 

While the new trailer for The Flash debuts the DCU's brand-new Supergirl, her origins may be taking inspiration from another major comic story beyond Flashpoint. Played by Sasha Calle, this new version of Superman's cousin will come onto the scene during a collision of worlds thanks to the unintentional efforts of Barry Allen's Flash. However, some interesting teases suggest Supergirl's debut will resemble one of DC's greatest Elseworlds stories from the comics.

The clashing of timelines seen in The Flash trailer is all inspired by DC's Flashpoint by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert. In the comic, Barry Allen wakes up to a massively altered reality, one in which he has no powers, and the lives of the Justice League have been massively changed. This all stems from his decision to go back in time and save his mother from being murdered, a moment that created a massive domino effect. As such, this is the basic framework The Flash will be working with, though it looks like Supergirl's origin will also adapt elements of a classic Superman story from Mark Millar.

Sin embargo, hace aproximadamente 66 millones de años, nuestro planeta volvió a cambiar de habitantes. Una catástrofe global, cuyos detalles se desconocen hasta el día de hoy, acabó con casi todos los animales de más de 25 kg, que habitaban la faz de la Tierra; además, en un lapso relativamente corto de tiempo, de acuerdo a los estándares geológicos. Los espacios desocupados fueron ocupados rápidamente por nuevos habitantes: mamíferos. Luego, éstos últimos, en el curso de una lucha constante por la supervivencia, dieron lugar a más y más formas nuevas de vida, hasta el nacimiento de una criatura única. En lugar de aceptar con sumisión las reglas de la naturaleza, esta criatura decidió construir sus propias reglas. No era el más grande, el más fuerte o el más rápido. Entonces, ¿Cómo se convirtió en el ""rey de la naturaleza""?

673,hebWYacbdvc,The Flash – Official Trailer,"On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash – only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie 

Warner Bros. Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.

Worlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? 

“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).

“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers 
are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.

Joining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch 
(“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.",2023-02-12 22:59:38+00:00,414.88287649666665,31,Warner Bros.

698,Kzo6wNPkDSk,Growing up in Mongolia | DW Documentary,"Otgo is the youngest child of a nomadic family in the Gobi desert. They make their living breeding cattle. Otgo loves their life, in harmony with nature and old traditions. Yet she dreams of becoming a dancer at the opera house in Ulan Bator.

In Mongolia, it is becoming increasingly common for the younger generation to leave traditional life behind. Otgo’s dream would take her far from her family’s yurt. She wants to become a dancer and later, a dance teacher. Her parents leave it up to her to decide how she wants to shape her life. They agree to support her, if she embarks on her great endeavor. In the meantime, Otgo has become an almost indispensable help to the family. She gets up early in the morning to water the camels with her father, and it fills her with pride that she can help her family. The breathtaking landscape of the Gobi Desert and the strong bonds between the different nomadic families do not make it easy for Otgo to follow her dream.

Otgo’s story paints a portrait of her world and of the men and women who have long passed on their culture from generation to generation, through the eyes of a child.

707,bS-gsJNCOtM,Shocking Discovery at the Well of Abraham: Tradition vs Archaeology,"In this video, we embark on a journey to solve the mystery of the ancient well believed to be dug by Abraham himself. With competing claims from another tourist site just miles away, we had to dig deep to uncover the truth. But what we found at Tel Beersheba left us absolutely stunned! With the help of a 19th-century explorer's book, we reveal more evidence that points to the true location of Beersheba. Buckle up and join us on this thrilling adventure as we explore this ancient land and unravel the secrets of Abraham's Well.

719,_C73ZZkFiUM,"Super Bowl Reactions, Tears of Joy & the Fan Base Name Revealed | New Heights | Ep 28","On the twenty-eighth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball, this is the definitive recap of Super Bowl 57. 

Jason and Travis weigh in on what they thought of the field conditions during pre-game warm-ups, seeing Donna Kelce on the jumbotron, what they were feeling during the anthem, and if there was any shit-talking during the coin toss. 

We then break down the game itself starting with a very Kelce-centric first quarter, how the Eagles responded to a huge turnover, and what adjustments the Chiefs made in the locker room down 10 at halftime. 

We also touch on the Chiefs starting the second half strong, how the Chiefs tied it all up with a play called “corn dog,” the third down play that Jason is still thinking about, Jalen Hurts clutch 4th quarter drive to tie the game, and Travis walks us through the Chiefs go-ahead field goal to clinch Super Bowl 57. 

Jason and Travis then give their final thoughts on the game’s “controversial” ending, the enormous emotions they were feeling seeing their family on the field, and Jason reveals the one thing that could have made this the greatest Super Bowl of all time. 

After the game discussion, we finally have Travis make his pick for the long-awaited name of the New Heights fan base, answer a not-dumb question about casting the inevitable “Kelce Bowl” movie and talk a little bit about what we have planned next for the show. 

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday & check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

As tough as its reputation may be, Dark Souls tries its best to give brand new players a helping hand as they find their barings in its hardcore world - unfortunately, the manner Dark Souls does this... accidentally tricks people into playing in a cowardly, risk averse way - meaning they have less fun, and are less willing to try and master the game's intricacies.

Entry Level Strategies are a powerful and crucial tool that allow videogames to ease in beginner players, but sometimes, they're too helpful for their own good, and end up ruining otherwise great games - how do they do this? and how did Elden Ring finally fix From Soft's most persistent design problem? One thing's for sure, in order to solve this particular conundrum, the Architect is going to need more than that 100% block shield they've been carrying around since the start of the game.

Many people consider HP Lovecraft's work as a fore runner for modern horror fiction as his work served as a pioneer for many horror genres and styles to come. With his out of the box strangeness and almost instantly recognizable style, his distinct work has become ubiquitous in the history of horror.

There are 9 legendary armaments in Elden Ring. Not all of them are legendary. In fact, some of them can be argued as suboptimal. Perhaps even disastrously, tragically inept. Some of them are outclassed by ordinary ""blue"" armaments, while others seem to be in a class of their own. I've run out of things to summarize about this video.

728,81CrB92Ixn8,Top 15 OPTIONAL Bosses You Missed in Elden Ring,"Ranking some of the greatest optional bosses that a lot of you probably missed in Elden Ring. No amount of talking about how massive this game is will ever do it proper service. It is truly a once-in-a-generation game that everyone must play for themselves. There are only around 10-12 actual bosses required to beat the game, but a good 90% of the game's content is actually not mandatory at all.

We just added an Elden Ring channel in our Discord. Come in and talk with us.

731,tdZ-RcLf5JQ,Elden Ring Lore | Deep Dive Into the Starting Classes,"The Tarnished were all once warriors but beyond that they have a complex history. Tarnished Hunters, Prophets who have seen the flame and inheritors of the Blind Swordsman. The Starting classes of Elden Ring each hold a story (mostly) that can provide a great bedrock of Lore. 

Intro: 0:00
Confessor: 1:25
Warrior: 6:17
Samurai: 12:19
Astrologer: 16:55
Prophet: 22:03
Hero: 25:37
Prisoner: 27:13
Vagabond, Bandit and Wretch: 33:20
Final Thoughts: 35:46

I found this to be a worthwhile subject as the starting classes are excellent on informing us about the cultures, crime, history and scope of the lands between as well as the nature of the Tarnished themselves.

766,Bd78wBDHALI,Israel's Problem with Russia is an Absolute Nightmare,"Why is Israel in a position where they are kind of forced to play nice with Russia, and how is Putin’s new relationship with Tehran driving Israel away? The war in Ukraine has clearly put new stress on this strange relationship. 

Written by: Chris Cappy & Patrick Griffin 
Edited by: Savvy Studios 

But something major has changed the relationship with Russia and Israel in an unexpected way. The Abraham accords announced in August 2020 completely rewrote the security relationships in the middle east. It was passed under US President Trump the Abraham accords was an effort to “encourage efforts to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue to advance a culture of peace among the three Abrahamic religions and all humanity.” The deal received bipartisan support in America and led to new forms of cooperation between two of the states that signed on Israel and the United Araba Emirates. but other muslim countries also improved relations with Israel like Azerbaijan and Sudan. 

Why is that? According to Israel's Ministry of Defense, the value of Israeli defense exports to countries with which it normalized relations in 2020 reached $791 million. Nothing gets rid of thousands of years of fighting like getting together and trading weapons. In fact between 2016–2020, Israel arms imports to Azerbaijan made up about 70 percent of their major weapon imports — and about 17 percent of Israel's arms exports. Add on Bahrain, Morocco, and Eygpt all normalizing relations with Israel and you’ve got a real coombya moment worthy of your aunts coexist bumper sticker.  There’s a new Israeli-Arab-US security order in the middle east aimed against Iran. Common enemy, check, weapons deals check, common favorite spread check.

I created this channel to help educate, inform, and teach people how to box, in a way that doesn't get taught much anymore. 

Also, to motivate and inspire people to be better versions of themselves, every day, with Boxing. 

7 National titles, a European gold medal in my 106 fights as a boxer. 

Co-owner of boxing fitness gyms in Los Angeles, CA called Box n Burn as well as a boxing fitness education program called The Box N Burn Academy where I teach people how to teach boxing for fitness. 

My main focus is my licensing company called Tony Jeffries Connect, where we give gyms a turnkey solution to add boxing classes in their facilities.

When I’m not shooting YouTube videos, you’ll find me enjoying family time with my  3 lovely daughters, posting funny yet educative content on Instagram and TikTok.

ABOUT 'GOT TALENT'
Got Talent is a British talent show TV format developed by Simon Cowell's SYCOtv company and owned by Fremantle Media Ltd. It has spawned spin-offs in over 70 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by Fremantle of the 'Idol' and 'The X Factor' singing show competition formats. Unlike those shows, Got Talent showcases a wide variety of artistic disciplines in addition to singing.

'Got Talent' was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by Guinness World Records. Cowell stated, “I am very proud that Got Talent is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen. And of course amazing talent.”

810,vxw3x1zVvEE,"Fury vs Wilder 3 FULL FIGHT: October 9, 2021 | PBC on FOX PPV","(Oct. 9, 2021) In an incredible back-and-forth that included five knockdowns and countless exchanges, Tyson Fury retained his WBC Heavyweight World Title and lineal crown with an eleventh-round TKO win over former long-time champion Deontay Wilder in an ESPN+/FOX Sports pay-per-view live from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

The UK’s Fury (31-0-1, 22 KOs) scored three knockdowns in all, the final two in the eleventh frame, sending the raucous crowd of 15,820 into a frenzy.

Fury got off to a hot start in the first round, landing quick one-two’s while Wilder worked the jab to the body. A hard right toward the end of the round punctuated it for Fury, as did another in the second.

The action heated up in the third when a big Fury right sent Wilder tumbling to the canvas. The game slugger from Tuscaloosa, Alabama rose to his feet, surviving the follow-up until the bell rang moments later.

With Wilder (42-2-1, 41 KOs) on unsteady legs in the fourth, Fury pounced, looking to finish him off. But just when it appeared that the fight was about to end, the “Bronze Bomber” uncorked a perfect short right followed by another, driving Fury to the mat.

Fury made it to his feet but was down again moments later when another Wilder flurry floored him. The bell rang seconds after he got up.

Wilder started strong in the fifth, blasting Fury with more rights. The “Gypsy King” maintained his composure, digging to the body in close quarters.

The inside work slowly wore Wilder down. He was dropped again in the tenth from another Fury right and then a third and final time in the eleventh via a crunching right cross. Referee Russell Mora mercifully rescued the brave warrior, ending the fight at 1:10 of the round.

811,do-cLmRhz0E,"Colbert vs Garcia FULL FIGHT: February 26, 2022 | PBC on Showtime","(February 26, 2022) Late replacement Hector Garcia battered and dropped the highly-touted Chris Colbert on his way to earning a unanimous decision in a 12-round WBA Super Featherweight World Title Eliminator.

Late replacement Hector Garcia performed like the world champion he was substituting for on Saturday night, battering and dropping the highly touted Chris Colbert to earn a unanimous decision in a 12-round WBA Super Featherweight World Title Eliminator that headlined a thrilling tripleheader live on SHOWTIME in a Premier Boxing Champions event from The Chelsea inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.
 
Garcia (15-0, 10 KOs) stepped in for the WBA Super Featherweight World Champion Roger Gutierrez less than three weeks ago after Gutierrez was forced to withdraw due to a positive COVID-19 test. Despite having little time to prepare, the southpaw Garcia used his height and powerful left hand to dominate Colbert (16-1, 6 KOs) by scores of 118-109, 118-109, and 119-108.  
 
“I have to thank everyone in my corner, Ismael Salas and Bob Santos, and everyone that worked with me,” said Garcia. “I feel great. I definitely knew three weeks ago that my life would change. My trainers gave me the confidence to win this fight.”
 
“I’m sorry I let everyone down, today he was the better man,” Colbert said afterward, his arm draped around Garcia in an encouraging embrace. “I take my losses like I take my wins. I want to run it back and hopefully we can do it again. There’s no excuses. He was the better man today.”
 
Garcia was the aggressor throughout, dropping Colbert for the first time in his career with a counter left in the seventh round that caused Colbert to fall backwards, his legs flying up in the air from the momentum. Colbert got to his feet, but Garcia jumped on him again, stalking him around the ring.
 
“In the ninth and 10th rounds I hit him so hard,” said Garcia. “I knew I had him. I knew he wasn’t going to be able to box anymore.”
 
Colbert could never get on track and showed little of the aggression and skills that made him one of the most talked about young fighters in the sport. 
 
“Everyone puts pressure on me in the ring,” said Colbert. “That’s nothing new. I want to get a rematch if I can. Congratulations to Hector and his team. They deserved this win tonight. I wasn’t feeling myself. At the end the day, I’m still ‘Primetime’ on SHOWTIME.”
 
In the end it was Garcia, a 2016 Dominican Olympian, who performed like the favored fighter, punishing Colbert and pushing him back and potentially earning a title shot against Gutierrez.
 
“I want to fight Gutierrez for the world championship,” Garcia said. “I worked too hard to get into this position today.”

How does physics make these shifting rainbows? We’re going to find out with the help of the National Museum of Natural History's most spectacular specimens – from bird feathers and beetle wings to fossils and gemstones.

835,ymGt7I4Yn3k,Russell's Paradox - a simple explanation of a profound problem,"This is a video lecture explaining Russell's Paradox. At the very heart of logic and mathematics, there is a paradox that has yet to be resolved. It was discovered by the mathematician and philosopher, Bertrand Russell, in 1901. In this talk, Professor Jeffrey Kaplan teaches you the basics of set theory (a foundational branch of mathematics dating back to the 1870s) in 20 minutes. Then he explains Russell’s Paradox, which is quite a thrilling thing if you are learning it for the first time. Finally, Kaplan argues that the paradox goes even deeper than Russell himself realized.

Also, I should mention Georg Cantor, Gotlob Frege, Logicism, and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in this description for keyword search reasons.",2022-09-08 15:18:27+00:00,4190.569265385556,0,Jeffrey Kaplan,UC_hukbByJP7OZ3Xm2tszacQ,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymGt7I4Yn3k/default.jpg,120,90,1708,hd,false,1944400,32361,0,7227,"I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

836,2OlcxUQ4jgM,Why Does The Universe Exist? Fan Grab Bag With Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Why does the universe exist? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice answer fan questions about black holes, wormholes, the expansion of the universe and more! What are our options to solve the crisis in cosmology?

Can we answer the question: why does the universe exist? We discuss the meaning of life and get scientific and philosophical with it. Is it all just physics? What happens to matter when it reaches the singularity and not just the event horizon? Learn about Hawking radiation and spaghettification and the mysteries that still persist. 

What’s the deal with the green comet? Find out about Oort cloud comets and where the comet gets its green. How big does an asteroid have to be to blow an atmosphere off a planet? What would happen if you pointed a laser pointer at a black hole? We explore gravitational redshift, time dilation, as well as how artificial intelligence will perceive the universe. Could we establish a wormhole for interstellar travel?

Discover the Big Rip and where the heat energy emitted from stars goes. Is the universe getting colder? We weigh the options for resolving the crisis in cosmology, how the JWST impacts it, and whether we are alone in the universe.  Plus, find out time travel theories on how the Titanic really sank.

Thanks to our Patrons Fadi Hayek, Kemlyn Brazda, pascale manales, Jules Martin, and Scott Alderman for supporting us this week.

NOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.

About the prints that flank Neil in this video:

Bajo el respaldo de la disquera DEL Records, el músico originario de Culiacán, Sinaloa, México, debutó en 2015 con su álbum de estudio ""Mi conquista"", material que incluye temas como 'La Fuga del jefe"", ""El Famoso Chino Ántrax"" y ""La Vida del Changuito"", entre otras.
 
En 2016, Lenin recibió un premio BMI por el tema ""El Awitado"" interpretado por Jorge Valenzuela y en el 2018, obtuvo su primer galardón de 'Premios de la Radio' por el tema ""Como Los Vaqueros"" mismo que interpreta al lado de otro talento de DEL Records Ulices Chaidez
 
En el 2019, su álbum ""Bendecido"" fue nominado a Premios Lo Nuestro como 'Mejor Álbum Sierreño del año', convirtiéndose así en un pionero de esta importante terna que apenas se abrió en los cotizados premios. Dicha producción se llevó el premio al 'Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano' del 2019

Poco tiempo después, Lenin Ramírez mostró su lado romántico con el lanzamiento de su nuevo sencillo: ""Estas ganas de tomar"". El tema es de la autoría de los talentosos Horacio Palencia y Giovanni Cabrera, en donde se muestra su lado romántico, faceta poco conocida del intérprete originario de Culiacán, Sinaloa y que se ha convertido en un nuevo éxito en la carrera de este talentoso cantante, una de las cartas fuertes de la disquera DEL Records.
 
A la par del lanzamiento de ""Estas ganas de tomar"", el flamante ganador del 'Latin Billboard 2019', en la categoría 'Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano', por su disco ""Bendecido"", también dio a conocer el video oficial del tema, producido por el equipo de producción de DEL Estudios, Lenin Ramírez. El video puede ser visto en el canal de YouTube de DEL Records.
 
Lenin obtuvo una nominación a Los Premios Juventud, dentro del rubro 'La Nueva generación del Regional Mexicano. Además, Ramírez tuvo una destacada participación en conduciendo un segmento del espectáculo.
 
A principios de septiembre, Lenin Ramírez apareció en la lista de nominados a los Latin American Music Awards, en la categoría: 'Álbum Favorito de Regional Mexicano', por su disco: ""Bendecido"".
 
Junto con la salida de ""Seguimos Adelante"", el ganador del Premio Billboard Latino al Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano, lanzó, además, el video de ""El Rata Güera"", un corrido muy ""meneado"" y ""pisteador"", muy al estilo de Ramírez que ya se puede apreciar en el canal de YouTube de DEL Records.

It takes at least four years of production before these ink sticks can be sold, and even longer for the most expensive ones. A 200-gram high-grade ink stick from a producer like Kobaien costs over $1,000. And at some other retailers, prices can reach almost $2,000. Meanwhile, almost double the amount of commercial India ink can go for as little as $9.

Editor's Note: The original version of this video incorrectly named the featured calligrapher as Shijo Azakami. His correct name is Sho Azakami. The original video incorrectly stated that monkey glue was used to make ink sticks, the correct type is donkey glue.

One of the hottest documentaries in the world right now is the Netflix production Ancient Apocalypse, featuring Graham Hancock – but some are calling on Netflix to pull it. Others are wondering how the series could be allowed in the first place. 
What is so bad about the series that it evokes reactions like these?
In this editorial, @AndreEinherjar will begin with a brief introduction of Graham Hancock and his thesis, as well as where he stands on the matter, just so you all have that in mind before we move on to my review of the Netflix series, and why I think the establishment archeology is doing itself a HUGE disfavor with the reaction that we are now seeing!

With wild claims of vague or impossible health benefits, most people chalk it up to just being a scam or just a harmless product designed to separate people from their money.

But the reality is so much worse. Negative ions are a very real thing, but making them takes energy. So how do you make a piece of plastic bracelet keep producing negative ions forever? Well, you fill it with radioactive material. In this video we go through all of the testing I did over the last few months to determine what's in these products and if they're dangerous.

There is so much amazing science and engineering that gets done, but most often the only ones who get to experience it first hand are those in expensive labs in universities. This channel aims to explore as much of fields of science and engineering as possible by showing real experiments and research being done in a fun and accessible way. While the goal is to show that even very hard science can be done in a DIY way, some projects will use some of the fancier toys that while less accessible, opens a broader range of projects that can be done. We cover everything from genetic engineering and tissue culture, to nuclear physics, to machine engineering, to chemical synthesis and more.",2010-05-11 02:02:46+00:00,4678.159828865811,63064834,109,1000000

Watch my exclusive Forgotten Atrocities episode on Operation Searchlight: https://nebula.tv/videos/joescott-forgotten-atrocities-operation-searchlight
On November 12, 1970, a cyclone hit the country of Bangladesh (which was known as East Pakistan at the time) that through a combination of bad timing, location, miscommunication, and political malice became the deadliest storm in human history, killing more than half a million people in one day. It became known as the Bhola Cyclone, and it set in motion a series of events that led to a genocide, a revolution, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

-----------------Lyrics----------------
A divine creature 
Ran through dimes, divas 
I turned blocks to beaches 
By the time you see us, we just 
Turned tides even 
Cuban chain, got the largest pieces 
But I’m wild for keepin’ it so timeless 
Almost half a century with a crispy lineup 
My peeps Salaam said I remind him of Martin Lawrence 
Breakin’ hearts on some real thin line sh*t 
I’m done with star chicks, I survived divorces 
I ain’t have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches 
Uh, I ain’t have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches 
I was the ill seed, the illest one 
The villainized, but I feel free 
And the field be 
Crazy way before the drill beef 
Doesn’t matter this is sheer relief, I feel the breeze this is… 
Superhero material, rap star status 
Premier album still might happen 
I wonder why Pete Rock would act like that 
That type of behavior make me give rap right back 
And now I can’t tell if all the good that I did’s bein’ hid with they agenda again, n*gga I know that yall prayin’ I go back to nuttin’ 
We in the future, let’s get past the frontin’ 
Let’s get money 

This is practice 
This is magic 
History, havoc 
Instant classic 
This is madness 
In all fairness 
We been movin’ how you f*ck n*ggas wanna 
My 30 for 30 highlights doin’ numbers 

Goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
I’m goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
Goin’ on thirty summers 
We been movin’ how you f*ck n*ggas want 
And my 30 for 30 highlights doin’ numbers 
Woo

We take a look at the past five years and our journey not having our son Bryce physically with us. It has been almost fourteen years that we have been without him, however we have shared five of those years here on youtube. Thanks for your support and for being a part of our family through all of this.

We share some of our most special traditions that we do to remember Bryce. We love to go visit his headstone and bring special keepsakes to decorate with. We release balloons, play together in the grass, take lots of pictures, and sometimes have a picnic.

""The Bigger Picture"" Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

Damn Kai, you going crazy
I be in the loop, she be in a group (yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
40 thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, why the fuck would you say that?
You can do it first, I'ma do it worse, gotta double the payback
Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

972,Dw0ViHDVhFk,Pokémon Legends Arceus - 1 Year Later (A Retrospective Review),"It has been over a year since the release of Pokemon Legends Arceus. In this video I take a look back at the game that left the community wanting more from the 'Legends' name. In this video, I talk about some of the main features of the game including the story, characters, combat, the good and the bad and what the future of the Legends franchise may look like.

There was a lot of stuff that I could have explored but I feel like I have covered a lot as is, so if you want me to make a follow up video discussing other topics let me know in the comments. Also, if you do enjoy this video, please give it a thumbs up and comment down below what you did or didn’t like about the game. I will be happy to hear your thoughts. 

Thanks for watching and I hope you have a great day!

973,DaUHU2I-haA,How Pokémon Red & Blue Were Made,"This Pokémon documentary details the development of the monster collecting RPG Pokémon Red & Blue and goes behind the scenes of their creation. Discover more about creator Satoshi Tajiri and how his love for bug catching led to the idea for Pokémon. The documentary also explores all the design decisions that development studio Game Freak, which consisted of only nine developers at the time, made and shows how Pokémon trainers were initially going to participate in battles with certain weapons for example.

It also takes a close look at all the hurdles Game Freak had to go through. The title was initially going to be “Capsule Monsters” but it had to be changed multiple times, because it resembled Ultraman’s Capsule Kaiju a little too much. Additionally, reducing over 200 designs for all the Pokémon to their favorite 151 proved to be a bigger challenge than anticipated. Furthermore, there was one moment during development that almost destroyed years of work. Lastly, the developers experienced serious problems when they were localizing Pokémon for various regions, because English for instance takes up more space than Japanese.

1018,onn-CT7feW8,What Was Hoyoverse Thinking!?... C0 Dehya Showcase & Build Guide (Genshin Impact),"Dehya is finally here... This video covers a massive showcase, optimal Dehya build guide & my thoughts about her.

In this video I cover almost everything you need to know in this Dehya Showcase video - I went through many, MANY different Dehya weapons and artifacts, tested about 9 different Dehya builds, checked how good is Dehya DPS and ultimately - I want to present you this video as one stop solution to decide if Dehya is worth it.

In addition to this, I've tested about 6 different best Dehya teams, examined what Dehya skills can do and even dug deep into how much investment Dehya needs. You'll also see things like popular Dehya + Melt Ganyu team showcased, popular variation of Mono Pyro Dehya, Dehya Burgeon damage going really well using Bloodtainted Greatsword weapon and MORE.

Angry Birds is now completely and utterly irrelevant. If you could travel back in time and tell this fact to somebody in the early 2010s, they simply wouldn’t have believed you. That’s because a decade ago, Angry Birds was more than just the #1 mobile-game series of all time. Angry Birds was a true media empire with games, toys, movies and more. But Now? The name “Angry Birds” is nothing but a distant memory. The brand has rapidly faded into irrelevance, and is now a forgotten relic of the Internet’s past.

At this point, the only hope for the company is in relying on the nostalgia factor of the joy we all felt a decade ago playing such a unique title.

1047,A10gB46C8bE,Rust - The True Enemy,"When Willjum invited me to play on the most highly populated server in Rust, I figured I would entertain the idea to prove to him how crazy it was... but then a story began to develop. A story within a story, and no matter how hard our rivals tried, they couldn't get us to walk away. Witness how a duo not only survived amongst clans, but came out as victors as well.

No Tech Tree Wipe will be taking place on Bloo Lagoon US and EU, March 2nd thru March 9th! More detailed info will be announced in the Bloo Lagoon Discord when the time gets closer: https://lagoonrust.com/discord

As you can see, I upload strictly Rust content. Since I started playing in 2016 it's been my favorite game. Over those years of enjoying Rust and the one of a kind content it has to offer, I've slowly been evolving my craft as a self-taught editor. I've edited every single one of my main channel videos and I intend to do so for the foreseeable future. So if my schedule seems a little inconsistent, just know I put so much love into every second, and that my process takes time. Thank you so much for watching and making my dream a reality!

1049,K8sBtXZVxzY,The Wasted Potential of the Far Cry Franchise,"'Far Cry' is one of the only franchises that has done everything right, just never all at once. Every major innovation and industry leading feature also came with it's own devastating effects on the gameplay and even after 20 years of back and forth game design, we have yet to see the formula reach it's potential.

In this video we'll be looking into every game in the franchise, the good, the bad, the surprises and the mistakes and how it evolved over time as the vision for what Far Cry should be changed.

He started out uploading beats on his YouTube channel in 2013, reaching a large audience all around the world. In 2017, Chuki decided to start a second YouTube channel (Chuki Beats II) where he made tutorials for other producers and slowly transitioned into showcasing his life as a producer and artist.

Moving to Brussels in 2019, he began working with the likes of Krisy, Zwangere Guy, Frenetik and Geeeko, he became one of the main driving forces of the Brussels scene. This resulted in Chuki releasing his first project in 2021 called 'INSIDEOUT'. A really well received project with a beautiful atmosphere, vibe and rollout, featuring many of Chuki's friends and colleagues. 

2022 is all about music for Chuki, as he's getting ready to release his new beat tape called 'Cozy Tapes' while also working on his debut album...

 Is Today's Video Sponsor! https://wehy.pe/y/1/FlippingOldschool
#clashofclans 

Welcome back to another episode of trader steve's journey across gilenor. In the last episode he unlocked the guardians of the rift minigame. Today we are going to be slowly grinding away at oldschool runescape's most powerful skilling outfit.

Not only will I be working on the runecrafting outfit, but I will also be unlocking multiple new chunks which will increase my runecrafting profits further!

Items to Collect List
https://imgur.com/a/aL2Jfk5

Rules:

-This is a main account that has access to the grand exchange.
-Money can be earned in any way, but no trading or transferring money over to Steve.
-Once a unique rare item from the list has been purchased a new adjacent chunk can be chosen. (I will allow an exceptions to use natural forms of transport such as ships, boats, canoes, minecarts etc
-To unlock new chunks each new item must be unique and not a repeat.

Dale  miénteme 
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  bebé 
Y  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Por  fa  miénteme
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo
Ay  dime  que  esta  noche  yo  soy  tu  bebé
Y  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Ay  ¿Quién  dijo  amigos? 
Si  te  conozco  mucho  más  sin  la  ropita 
Sé  que  tenés  ganitas  de  estar  conmigo 
Aunque  cuando  hay  gente  me  decís  amiguita 
Sé  que  tú  necesitas

Si  las  miradas  mataran  (tan  tan  tan) 
Tú  y  yo no estaríamos  vivos  papi  (na  na  na) 
Cuando  estamos  acompañados  solo  bla  bla  bla 
Pero  si  estamos  solitos  mucho  mua  mua  mua  (x2) 
(TINI  TINI  TINI)

Dale  miénteme haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  bebé 
Aunque  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos 
Por  fa  miénteme haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Ay  dime  que  esta  noche  yo  soy  tu  bebé 
Y  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Estoy  más  clara  que  el  agua 
Baby  fluyo  aunque  mañana  te  vayas 
Yo  no sé qué me pasa Pero  hoy  quiero  pasarme  de  la  raya

Porque  si  me  besas Las  ganas  se  me  suben  a  la  cabeza 
Hoy  mezclamos  el  tequila  con  cerveza 
Porque  yo  sé  que  en  el  fondo  a  ti  te  gusta 
Dale  confiesa

Porque  si  me  besas 
Las  ganas  se  me  suben  a  la  cabeza 
Hoy  mezclamos  el  tequila  con  cerveza 
Porque  yo  sé  que  en  el  fondo  a  ti  te  gusta 
Solo  confiesa

Dale  miénteme 
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  lady 
Aunque  mañana  somos  amigos,  amigos

Dale  miénteme 
Haz  lo  que  tú  quieras  conmigo 
Dime  que  esta  noche  yo soy  tu  bebé

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails, cherry red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
Ooh, I didn't wanna wanna leave you, baby
I didn't wanna fight

LETRA:

Recuerdo que contigo fue tan diferente,
tan natural
Jugando, me decías que leías mi mente
y era verdad

Aún guardo cada carta que me diste
y aunque hay palabras que nunca dijiste
El tiempo que tuvimos no fue
suficiente para olvidar, no

Aunque yo sé que es tarde
para recordar

Una noche rota
Fue la última vez que te perdí
Una vida loca
Cuando sin querеr me despedí

Y hoy quе tú ya no estás,
tú ya no estás
Tú ya no estás aquí

Se quedó en mi boca
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid

Parecen solo días y va casi un año, y aunque lloré
Yo sé que estamos bien, pero a veces te extraño
Yo te adoré

Yo te adoré con locura
y aunque el tiempo todo lo cura
Hay amores que se olvidan,
y hay que amores que siempre duran

Esto no fue una aventura,
pero tuvo que terminar

Aunque yo sé que es tarde
para recordar

Una noche rota
Fue la última vez que te perdí
Una vida loca
Cuando sin querеr me despedí

Y hoy quе tú ya no estás,
tú ya no estás
Tú ya no estás aquí

Se quedó en mi boca
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid

Sé que hubo un beso en Madrid
Un beso en Madrid 
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid, no

Un beso en Madrid
Hoy quedan en mí
Una historia, una canción
y un beso en Madrid",2020-10-31 23:57:44+00:00,20429.914543163333,0,Silvia Zc,UCqbdzysdltRoVFskIf_j7-g,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ircObGRWl9A/default.jpg,120,90,144,hd,false,1394774,13418,0,143,"Si te dedicas a la música y quieres publicidad en mi canal escríbeme por instagram: https://www.instagram.com/silvia.Zc_/

[Intro: Yandel & Feid]
Déjate ver, dime si hoy vas pa' la calle, bebé
'Toy en el case pensándote otra vez
Quiero pichear, pero me salió al revés
Mi amor, a las dos paso por ti, ve arreglándote
Hoy to' corre por la mía, relájate
Prometí que no iba a hacerte daño
Así me sienta' extraño, soy el que se quedó en tu piel
[Pre-Coro: Feid]
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo quе nunca me cuentas (Me cuеntas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Coro: Yandel & Feid]
Dale hasta abajo que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
E-E-El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Verso 1: Yandel]
Tú ya-Tú ya sabe' lo que quiero, baby, fluya
A ti mucha' te envidian, pero tú estás en la tuya
Mamá, un baile privado pa'l que no sepa na'
Y ya bajamo' tensión
Vine a buscarte, tú sabes la intención
Perreamo' esta canción
Después me dice', ma, que te pareció
Y yo no sé, pero me dio contigo
Estaba ruteando, pensándote y salí del caserío
Quiero probarte, que sea esta noche
Bebé, me traje la corta por si me meto en un lío

[Coro: Feid]
Dale hasta abajo que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
E-E-El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Verso 2: Feid]
'Toy en el punto, bebé, pero estoy pendiente de ti
Los peine' están full, la moto full de gasoli
Gafitas Oakley, machea con la white tee
Me dice ""FERXXO"", qué rico se lo metí
Esa noche 'e jangueo, de fumeteo
Contigo to' los partie' son de perreo
Bebé, cuando te veo, yo te leo
Tú te pierde', mami, yo te rastreo, oh
Baby, me la paso joseando, no tengo de otra
Hagamo' que esta noche sea larga, bebé, porque la vida e' muy corta

[Coro: Yandel & Feid]
Dale hasta abajo, que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde', eh-eh
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche, eh-eh
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

1131,eK2cuu59WLk,Alyse Maree - Light as a Feather (Miscarriage song),"'Light as a Feather’ composed and sung by Alyse Maree.

This song is for every parent that has lost their baby & to my angel who had a big brother and eager parents already loving you so much! For 11 weeks we got to dream of a future with you. It was a routine doctor visit to check up on our baby’s growth that would change my whole world in an instant. 

If this song brought some comfort or resonated with you, please feel free to share with your other girlfriends who may have gone through this and really try to stick together wherever we can. I really wanted to help shine an important and necessary light on pregnancy loss.

Also (if interested) please subscribe to my channel where I will be uploading more content soon! Stay strong! You’ve got this, even if you think you don’t. You will!

My Personal Experience in Miscarriage and this song:

As someone who has endured and felt the heartbreak of miscarriage, I have written this song to promote awareness of the women, parents and families who go through miscarriage, stillbirth or other loss of pregnancy. 

When I fell pregnant with my second baby naturally, I was overjoyed as I’ve had previous fertility challenges (Endometriosis stage 4 and PCOS) my first born Maxy was an IVF baby! 

I had what’s called a missed miscarriage and for me it meant finding out at 11 weeks that the baby I had been carrying’s heart stopped beating at 8 weeks. I really struggled with this and I remember searching YouTube for a song to help me through these times, but there was no song that I personally could resonate with! When it all felt too much and I couldn’t sleep I went to my piano, sat there in the dark and started writing again. So, here is the result of that night. My own song that would help me through.

I believe women should be able to celebrate their pregnancies for the time they are pregnant and to grieve with the same people who loved hearing the news! Often women don’t tell anyone for the first 12 weeks and in turn have no support if that baby is unfortunately lost. I feel if we can openly talk about falling pregnant, being pregnant and any loss then we can be supported by each other from start to end.

The song will be officially launched on all music platforms (iTunes, Spotify, Amazon etc.) on 15 October – International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day.

1133,93yJTL-260w,As It Was - Harry Styles,"🎶Lyrics:
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

🎤 Lyrics: Paloma Faith - Only Love Can Hurt Like This

[Verse 1]
I tell myself you don't mean a thing
And what we got got no hold on me
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die 'till I feel your touch

[Chorus]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

[Verse 2]
Say I wouldn't care if you walked away
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay
When you come close I just tremble
And every time, every time you go
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

[Chorus]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this
[Bridge]
But it's the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture, makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this

[Chorus]
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt like this)
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt)
Save me, save me
Only love, only love
'Cause only love can hurt like this
And must've been a deadly kiss

Tim Henson has undoubtedly become one of the world's most distinct guitarists and has been appraised by numerous media outlets as well as Steve Vai. How did Polyphia grow to get where they are? How did Tim Henson along with Polyphia become THE biggest name in modern guitar and instrumental music. As the faces of Ibanez guitars, Polyphia has a unique image and are sitting on a throne that will not be taken from them anytime soon.

When I was 16, I learned what the Appalachian Trail was. Being an ambitious teenager, I decided that one day I was going to attempt the trek from Georgia to Maine. I realized that goal in 2018, and completed numerous smaller hikes in the years leading up to my AT hike.

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.

Like ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server.

Either I couldn't get my hands on the puppy on time or it they just weren't the right fit for Honey. I knew my honey needed a little sister to play with and I knew I was ready for one more. Unexpectedly my friends came across this baby and brought it to my attention. I fell involve with her and knew she would be perfect.

1185,_BTtNgrKDlo,Elden Ring - Lake of Rot: Alabaster Lord Sword,"For him to spawn it seems you need to activate all the previous platforms, not just the one displayed in the video.

""Dance Moms"" follows Abby Lee Miller and the nation's favorite tween dancers as they take on Hollywood while new auditions, new competitions, and new studios raise the stakes.

The road has not been easy for “Dance Mom’s” star Abby Lee Miller. After completing her prison sentence last year, the famed dance instructor was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. But if anything, Abby has proven she is a fighter and is not ready to hang up the dance shoes. The new season of Dance Moms follows Abby as she rebuilds her dance company while battling the after-effects of cancer that has left her confined to a wheelchair. Abby is ready to get back to her life and do what she loves most…teaching students to dance! With the goal of putting her life, health and dance studio back together, Abby returns to where it all began – the Abby Lee Dance Company in Pittsburgh.",2021-09-19 16:00:39+00:00,12685.865932052222,31,Dance Moms,UCe4TiRe3lU6kGVr9S3_2SCA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSYAm8pyP-k/default.jpg,120,90,638,hd,false,1170294,18856,0,535,"Dance Moms follows children's early steps on the road to stardom along with their doting mothers all under Abby Lee Miller's discerning eyes. Presenting a powerful cast of characters, the show immerses itself in the highs and lows surrounding dance competition season, delivering a captivating and dramatic look at the cast's intense pursuit of National Dance titles. Centered on the devoted Miller, who runs Abby Lee Dance Company with an iron tap shoe as she instructs her young, talented students while also dealing with impassioned mothers who go to great lengths to help their children's dreams come true, Dance Moms is about what really goes on behind-the-scenes in the fast-growing and controversial sport of competitive dance.",2016-11-23 19:37:39+00:00,2289.42727099544,1016196724,621,1270000

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. 

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)

So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.

Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.

4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) 

We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!

We started our YouTube channel on a whim when we decided to take a year off and go travel back in 2016. One year quickly turned into 4, and at the very end of 2019 we stepped foot in our 100th country. If you want a quick summary of that journey you can watch the documentary here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg

Shortly after achieving our 100 country goal, the pandemic hit. With international travel no longer an option, we bought a van and spent two years traveling around the U.S. living in our tiny home on wheels.

At the beginning of 2022, we moved out of the van and back into our suitcases full-time. We're not exactly sure what our next ""goal"" is going to be, but we're currently having fun bouncing around the globe chasing our passions and interesting stories.

1218,sMDonnsUn-0,Was South Park Right About Family Guy Jokes?,"This video essay analyzes South Park's criticism of Family Guy's joke writing and storytelling. In 2006, South Park's Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy was poorly written as the jokes were interchangeable. This deep dive uncovers the truth about both comedy shows writing style and the merits on both sides of the argument.

The thing about this run is that if i want to stay loyal to Ranni, i cannot accept melina and that means no levelups, no horse, no roundtable. So basically a rune level 1 run+Ranni quest.
This was fun but got painful on the last few bosses because i suck at this game, still worth it tho.
I know there was things that i could have done better, but whatever.
Elden ring is such a great game.

It was a car built by a team of dedicated madmen,
Whose blood had long since been replaced by gasoline.
Hillbillies and bush mechanics, 
moonshiners working without oversight on a singular goal: 

Revive the spirit of AMERICA. 

Legends who would go on to become Redneck Rockstars. 

This is the story of rebels,
Of criminals and corporate suits,
Who came together to save America.

And build the Dodge Viper.

A Scanner Darkly - Philip K. Dick

Bird by Bird - Anne Lamott (Seriously, if you're having any trouble with any artistic path, this is the one.)

1225,VMxjFTtTquc,Dodge Hellcat Outruns Chopper in Houston Police Chase! Driver Almost Makes it,"Dodge Hellcat almost gets away from Houston Police after outrunning helicopters - http://abc13.com

Direct Link: http://abc13.com/2524298/

DRIVER SENTENCED: https://abc13.co/2K7eeyg

A high-speed police chase sprinted across the greater Houston area over lunch time, involving a 200MPH stolen Dodge Hellcat with a deputy's flying tackle ending the wild scene in a cow pasture.

Original chase: 10/13/17

It all started around noon when a suspect in a stolen white car led officers in pursuit along I-10. Speeds, at times, topped well over 100 mph. After roughly an hour, the suspect got off the freeway at the Winnie exit.

At about 1 p.m., the suspect pulled over to the side of Highway 73 south of Beaumont, and got out of the car. He took off on foot into a wooded area.

Officers searched for the driver amid the brush before he was spotted, walking casually and talking on his cell phone. A deputy tackled the man and he was taken into custody by helicopter.

Officers with Houston Police Department and at least one other Harris County agency began the pursuit. Texas DPS troopers, Chambers County Sheriff's deputies and the Beaumont Police Department helicopter assisted in the search.

The driver has been identified as Mohmed Ahmed Abu-Shlieba, 25. He was believed to have been armed during the chase. He was in a stolen vehicle, and had active warrants. There's no word on what new charges he may face.

1236,JZ6vFGldyq4,Ted Lasso: 15 Things You Missed,"When it comes to winning, AFC Richmond are relative strangers, but the series is no stranger when it comes to winning big with them taking home multiple Emmys as well as being one of the most popular comedy series around, and currently that big time fruit company’s flagship series. Like the titular hero, the show has been a surprising hit, charming, loveable and deeper than you originally thought. Not only does it do a great job at capturing football culture and respecting the sport, but it also dives into more difficult and sensitive topics, all while being genuinely hilarious with some of the best, colorful characters on TV (he’s here, he’s there, he’s every blanking where, Roy Kent!). 

That’s why we thought we’d take another look at the show at all the things you may not have noticed the first time around. This will include easter eggs, hidden references, pop culture nods, behind the scenes secrets and general facts all of which went into making the show such a success story. We will talk about all of the sneaky references to real life people, all of the hidden movie references or subtle verbal nods, cast members who auditioned for other roles, others who sent embarrassing tapes to get the role, real life inspirations behind AFC Richmond and their players, injuries that happened on set, and how the show got made in the first place. Diamond Dogs on 3 - 1, 2 3 - DIAMOND DOGS!

1269,UKqkb4cEy-E,Miquella and Malenia: The Full Story | Elden Ring Lore,"Of all the twins in Elden Ring (which there is a surprisingly high number of), none are more recognizable than the twin Empyreans known as Miquella, the Unalloyed, and Malenia, Blade of Miquella. As the children of Marika and Radagon, they are some the most pivotal and powerful figures in the Lands Between.

But, for many players, figuring out how these siblings fit into the lore and story of Elden Ring can be surprisingly difficult. On top of that, both Miquella and Malenia have loads of cut content that never made it into the final game.

This video aims to go through all the major points of their timeline with a unique approach to the visuals, so I hope that ends up being something you enjoy!

1272,m4YZcEc1qgI,Elden Ring Lore | Morgott: His Story,"The Lore of Morgott in Elden Ring is a tale for the ages. From his origins as an Omen born of Marika and Godfrey, his responsibility during the Night of Black Knives, fighting in the Shattering against Rykard, Radahn and any Tarnished vying to become Lord, to his failure to be accepted by the Greater Will, Morgott remains one of few characters to uphold his honour throughout his life. His role is of key importance both for the history of the Lands Between and for our playthrough in the current day.
