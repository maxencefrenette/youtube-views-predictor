1,vPib9KwCBGs,Titans: The Final Episodes | Official Trailer | DC,"What’s born in blood will end in bloodshed. The final episodes premiere April 13 only on #HBOMax.

In the mid-season premiere, the Titans - with the exception of Gar - are returned to the place they had vanished, the Temple of Trigon, only to find Sebastian and Mother Mayhem are no longer there. The Titans rush to find them before Sebastian summons Trigon, their pursuit leading them to a mysterious town whose populace is hiding a deep secret. Along the way, the Titans come across a prophecy that may require Kory to make a huge sacrifice to save the world, but Dick's feelings for Kory surface and he refuses to let her die. In the final episodes, the Titans enter into an epic battle to save both Kory and the world. Gar goes on a quest of self-discovery, attempting to find his true purpose and to save his friends. Rachel embraces darker powers while Conner, struggling with his Lex Luthor side, goes his own way to defeat Sebastian. Tim and Bernard’s growing feelings for each other become increasingly difficult to resist, and when Bernard’s life is threatened, Tim finally becomes the hero he has always strived to be.

In this video MrBeast will do a funny challenge with his friends for $10,000 where everyone try to be the  last to leave. This video challenge is for entertainment but it is not a prank. A real boat worth over $10,000 is being given away all for the fun of it. I also started a new tiktok which is similar to vine which you should check out. If you like my videos you might also want to check you PewDiePie’s Try not to laugh series.

An accessible English dub is available for anyone unable to read subtitles; you can turn it on in your device's player settings. It's experimental and using an AI-generated voice, so it's a long way from perfect, and I can't guarantee it'll be available for future videos, or even for this one long-term! But hopefully it's a step in the right direction.

There was no way to put this in the main video, but I have to point to some of the bleak history of Kennaook / Cape Grim, and the massacre that happened there: https://www.ourtasmania.com.au/northwest/history-cape-grim-mass.html

91,voYdl7IFZsM,I climbed inside a giant robotic parking garage,"I was going to film a video about a robot bicycle park. And then GIKEN, the company who built it, said: you know we do this for cars as well, right? ■ More details: https://www.giken.com/en/products/automated-parking-facilities/

I'm a bit worried that this comes across as an advert. It's not — I reached out to the team at GIKEN, they had no editorial control, and no money changed hands. (Although they did, of course, go through all the paperwork required to let me climb into their giant robot parking garage.) They also asked me to include this: “Eco Cycle and Eco Park are brand names of GIKEN LTD. in Japan”, which seemed a reasonable enough request.

An accessible English dub of this video is available. Plus, as there was (unusually) room for it in this video, there's also a version with audio description. You can turn those on in your device's player settings. Both are experimental and use an AI-generated voice, so they're a long way from perfect; I can't guarantee they'll be available for future videos, or even for this one long-term! But hopefully it's a step in the right direction.

154,_BZIxt07UNU,This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World...,"This Minecraft Mod Will Change The World... this has never been done before.

This was one of the most incredible projects I have ever worked on.

Twitter: @Dream
Instagram: @DreamWasTaken
Snapchat: @Dream

In this video, we coded a Minecraft mod that live translates languages through a voice chat above your character in Minecraft. It has fairly good accuracy and can translate most languages around the world. This mod allows you to play Minecraft, make jokes, and have fun with people that can't even speak your language.  

Live voice translation has been being worked on by Google and other companies, and they provide API's for it.  Google glass , apple glasses, and other similar products have been talked about for years with mentions of live-translating interactions in real life. We thought about taking that, and applying it to gaming.

I truly believe that this is the near future for all online games with voice chat, with being able to play and communicate with anyone from anywhere, breaking down the language barrier. I also believe that this is a cool glimpse into the future in real life. If a bunch of kids can do it at home in one of the biggest games in the world, a bunch of engineers and geniuses can make it happen in real life.

In this video there were plenty of languages, and I was able to laugh and joke with all of them. When testing this mod, I played with friends of mine that spoke different languages, and we were having so much fun playing together and laughing about how crazy it was that we could communicate with each other.

This has been being worked on for a while and I'm so happy to finally share it with everyone. There are some bugs still, and in this version a couple of the notable bugs were: Minecraft words being incorrectly translated, names being incorrectly translated, and your last word not showing up sometimes.

Whenever this mod's bugs are fixed and it's features are added, I plan on releasing this to the public for free, and with open source so anyone can make any additions they want with ease. Depending on what API is used for transcribing/translations and how many people are being translated, it can be costly, so although the mod will be free from me, using it might require setup on your end.

I am releasing an SMP, the ""United SMP"", which is going to feature creators from all around the world. Equal representation from the languages that are on it, with a mock EU-style committee to make decisions so there is not one owner. This will be launching hopefully later this month, and has 60 creators to start with, 10 of which will be English speaking, 50 of which will be from 5 other languages. Most of these people are people I never would have been able to collaborate with, or make jokes with, or share with my fans, so I am so excited to share our community with the world. There will be more details on my twitter about this, and I will be live streaming the server in the future.

thank you guys for watching and supporting the channel to make stuff like this possible.",2023-04-03 01:33:01+00:00,27.211407647499996,3,Dream,UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BZIxt07UNU/default.jpg,120,90,1518,hd,false,2621190,225478,0,16205,"Minecraft stuff, yes, my IGN is Dream",2014-02-08 18:20:05+00:00,3341.434473850799,2905886930,116,31500000

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost tries to prevent me from doing it.

After years of being completely faceless online, I finally decided to do a face reveal, and after that my life completely changed. MrBeast took me to Antartica, and it was some of the craziest days of my life.

Antarctica is nothing like anywhere else on earth. The sun never sets, the snow is deeper than you can dig, and the wind is hurricane-like at all times. You have to wear special gear to go outside, to avoid frostbite and also snow blindness. It felt like living on a different planet. The Ice Planet.

Antarctica was incredibly cold, and surviving 50 hours in the wilderness was crazy. It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.

Being able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!). I still want to do one in real life as well. Sorry for the lack of uploads!

Fun fact: Antarctica is the biggest desert on earth!

We challenged a developer to code 100 floors that increase in difficulty, with one goal, kill us! If they kill us before we beat the 100th floor, they win. If we survive 100 floors, we win. 100 floors may feel like 100 days of hardcore in this challenge :)

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.17 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and find ways to die random deaths that are selected after each round. We have five minutes to find out how to die the way that was chosen before we lose. Me and my friend George both get different random deaths, and whoever loses first loses the game.

This is a little different than my normal content. Rather than being about combat or about trapping, this is about racing and about general Minecraft skills. This was super fun, challenging, and pretty funny overall.

This video is a different rendition of my normal challenge videos, where there are THREE hunters trying to stop me from beating Minecraft.

We're so close to 30 million subscribers! Make sure to subscribe :) also congrats to Mr Beast on 100 million!!!

In this challenge, the pot starts at 1 million dollars and it goes down $69 every 1 second. When I beat the game, the money that's left is given away to a RANDOM SUBSCRIBER! So make sure to subscribe! There's a catch though. If I don't beat the game quick enough, the money goes into the negatives, and that's how much I have to pay my 3 friends that are hunting me down!

It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes, I might try and convince someone else to do it! 

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

FULL LIST OF MY GAMES/COOKIES OF THE YEAR:
5. Monster Hunter Rise
Recipe: https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/snowball-cookies-that-melt-in-your-mouth/
(Just split it into three and add gel food coloring. They are a little crumbly, so maybe don't try to skewer them.)

4. Metroid Dread
Recipe: https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/classic-peanut-butter-blossom-cookies/a3563f6e-96b0-443f-ae0a-53cef4be6db6
(I had to put in 50 drops of purple food coloring and it barely worked. Also, I just squished green M&Ms on the top and used green icing from a supermarket. This is a child's cookie and that's what makes it great.)

3. Death's Door
Recipe: https://tasty.co/recipe/macarons
(I piped a few extra little dots of the macaron batter in order to make the handles for Pothead and attached them with buttercream. I broke up some thin pretzel sticks for his log neck.)

2. Resident Evil Village
Recipe: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10766-biscotti or this one if you don't want to subscribe there: https://www.shelovesbiscotti.com/almond-biscotti/
(I replaced half the almonds with raw pistachios to add a little extra chewiness. I melted chocolate chips in the microwave and then painted them on the bottoms and let them set.)

1. Inscryption
Recipe: It's plain old shortbread. I used this recipe: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018784-shortbread-10-ways
but you could probably use any solid shortbread recipe.
(I piped on black icing to make the cookie. I did not take a photo of a person and transfer their consciousness into the cookie. Stop asking if I did.)

More about The Warhorn (from Steam):

The Warhorn is a medieval RPG mixed with city-building and management elements. Play as an adventurer who decided to leave his dull life as a lumberjack behind to explore a dangerous world full of puzzles in the pursuit of the most valuable relic mankind has ever seen: The Warhorn!

Weary of the life as a lumberjack, you decide to leave the safe walls of your homeland in order to travel far away and begin the life of an adventurer. Months later, just as you start to doubt your decision, you arrive on an archipelago where you hear about something called “The Warhorn”: A relic capable of granting immortality!

You decide to settle on one of the islands – where your story shall begin. 
The Warhorn is a take on the unique mixture of genres, the most important ones being RPG and city-building/management while other distinctive elements in the game come from the exploration, puzzle and open world genres.

Explore a vast open world: Including 5 themed biomes like spring / summer, autumn, winter, desert and jungle having their own unique sub-biomes with their own unique resources and denizens.

Solve challenging puzzles: While most of them can be done alone, some might need a helping hand – or two.

Face various foes: Every biome comes with its own set of animals, beasts and other denizens. Some of them may be neutral, but others could be deadly.

Learn new skills: Wield a sword, swing a hammer or laugh at brute force and master the elements like fire, ice and light. Villagers can teach you many things, but in order for them to share their knowledge, you might have to earn their trust first… or a sizeable amount of riches.

Build your empire: Learn how to build with different materials and create a village to your liking. Villagers will gather resources for you while your villages’ soldiers are protecting your empire.

Be ready for war: Build powerful war machines to either defend your village or attack another in a fight for resources, relics and secrets of this world.
Multiplayer: Everything in the game can be done together. Build the most incredible empire with your friends, trade with other empires or fight against them.

Sent to find a missing billionaire on a remote island, you find yourself in a cannibal-infested hellscape. Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.

A Survival Horror Simulator
Experience complete freedom to tackle the world how you want. You decide what you do, where to go and how best to survive. There are no NPC's barking orders at you or giving you missions you don't want to do. You give the orders, you choose what happens next.

Fight Demons
Enter a world where nowhere is safe and fight against a range of mutated creatures, some who are almost human like, and others who are like nothing you have ever seen before. Armed with pistols, axes, stun batons and more, protect yourself and those you care for.

Build and Craft
Feel every interaction; Break sticks to make fires. Use an axe to cut out windows and floors. Build a small cabin, or a sea-side compound, the choice is yours.

Changing Seasons
Pluck fresh salmon directly from streams in spring and summer. Collect and store meat for the cold winter months. You're not alone on this island, so as winter rolls in and food and resources become scarce you won't be the only one looking for a meal.

Co-op Gameplay
Survive alone, or with friends. Share items and work together to build defenses.

More about Meeple Station (from Steam):

DISCLAIMER: Meeple Station is in active development and is therefore subject to constant change. Nothing is representative of final gameplay. We update as often as possible so during it's Alpha state, There-Will-Be-Bugs. We try our best to smash them as soon as we're aware of them so most bugs are fixed shortly after patch-days. We'd appreciate if you gave the in-game bug report button a nice hard punch and let us know if you encounter any during your play - it helps us quickly get them fixed. We always endeavor greatly to not break saves- because that's annoying, but it's not always avoidable. Thankfully we've only had to do that once so far. So sorry bout that one, but ya' can't win 'em all.
So What Is Meeple Station?

So What Is Meeple Station?

Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee!
Meeple need things to live!

Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire.

Trade!

At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets.
Fight off lazy pirates!

Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers.

We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem.

How to Be the Worst Neighbor In Existence - Junkyard Truck

#LetsGameItOut #Simulation

----------

Check it out on Steam ► https://store.steampowered.com/app/1697880/Junkyard_Truck/

More about Junkyard Truck (from Steam):

Junkyard Truck is an open-world off road driving, mechanic simulator, and job simulator. Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You'll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories- or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you're low on funds. Jobs and missions pay well, but you'll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map's challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps.

If you're not good with mechanics, don't worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash.

- Fully integrated stock engine and drivetrain with over 60 stock parts, a swappable V8 engine with even more parts, and lots of aftermarket parts.
- Upgradeable parts such as EFI conversion, headers, drive gears, turbochargers, several off road tire options, and accessories.
- Fully responsive engine and drivetrain which exhibits true-to-life performance and auditory feedback on part failure, temperature, or fluid issues.
- Miles of off road trails and roadways.
- Open world game with freedom to play how you want to play.
- Off road challenges; some which are difficult, others which are nearly impossible.
- Make money with heavy delivery missions, rescue missions, collecting junk around the map and recycling it at the junkyard. Or work for yourself by brewing moonshine, logging, mining, or pressing your luck at the pub playing Texas Hold'em.
- Day and night cycle, requiring you maintain your food, hydration, and sleep.
- Softbody physics.",2022-09-30 15:00:14+00:00,4453.757796536389,23,Let's Game It Out,UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J_8KmRw8610/default.jpg,120,90,1058,hd,false,3776117,156121,0,5963,"A gaming let's play channel by some guy named Josh who makes fun-loving videos filled with joy and sarcasm.

We live on a water planet. And the currents generated in the oceans affect all of our lives, even if you don't live near the ocean. So as evidence seems to mount that the North Atlantic Gulf Stream is weakening - in fact, it's the weakest it's been in over a thousand years - that's something to pay attention to.

But is it the doomsday scenario many people are predicting? Let's take a look.

It took humans 10,000 years to go from hunter-gatherers to world domination. Considering the vastness of time that humans and life have been on Earth, could this have happened once before?

This question was put forth by Adam Frank and Gavin Schmidt in their paper titled The Silurian Hypothesis, where they tried to figure out what in the geologic record would be a sign of a previous industrial civilization. It brings up a lot of questions and makes you deal with the weight of deep time, as well as the fleeting nature of history.

Venus has long been called Earth's twin, because our sizes are so similar. But as we learned in the early 60s, on our surface we couldn't be more different. This wasn't always the case though. It's thought that up until about 500 million years ago, our planets were very similar, in fact Venus may have supported life. So what happened?

With all the talk of UFOs, or as they're now known, UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), and the soon-to-be-released Pentagon report addressing the phenomenon, and the leaked fighter pilot videos, and the hundreds of emails and comments I've received... I decided to chime in on the situation.
This should go over well. In no way will this video be taken too seriously.

Here are some of the ""Dueling explanations"" videos around the internet. Take a look and come to your own conclusions.

Watch my exclusive Forgotten Atrocities episode on Operation Searchlight: https://nebula.tv/videos/joescott-forgotten-atrocities-operation-searchlight
On November 12, 1970, a cyclone hit the country of Bangladesh (which was known as East Pakistan at the time) that through a combination of bad timing, location, miscommunication, and political malice became the deadliest storm in human history, killing more than half a million people in one day. It became known as the Bhola Cyclone, and it set in motion a series of events that led to a genocide, a revolution, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

Moving devious feel like I’m mad max  
Pull up get whacked then get dragged where the trash at

Catch me a rapper I’m taking his jewelry

Oh you gonna spot em we got em we drop em  
Like no talking we not with the nonsense  
Like Die Y what’s a goon to a goblin 
Like any problem I bet Ima solve it  
Gotta be ease I can’t love on a bitch  
I got certain reasons I don’t trust me a bitch 
30s Dougz up now they say I’m the shit  
And these niggas be mad that a young Nigga rich  

I’m just playing ain’t get in my bag yet  
Married to money no cuffing I’m past that  
On the 4th tryin flock at his dad hat  
Flock off the peddle 
 I’m catching a flash back  
Moving devious feel like I’m mad max  
Pull up get whacked then get dragged where the trash at  
30k or better in the backpack  
30 sticks ladders and we moving mad tact

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

Ayo Sam 
I stay with the cuz 
Make it hot any weather 
I ride for my brothers 
We flocking together  
Pour straight out of the bottle  
Don’t need me a measure 
It’s forty and better when I’m at the teller 
I spot em I boomin at you and whoever 
Whenever, I promise you this shit is feathers  
My flockas I love ‘em I got em forever 
When flocka come home we gon get it together  

I been the aggressor applying the pressure 
I signed it was treasure  
And then it got better 
And then it get better and better and better  
Right under the sweater 
I’m ready whenever 
Ain’t cuffing these bitches  
Ain’t no love for no heifer 
You jackin the fellas  
but ain’t sending no money 
ain’t checking on mommy 
ain’t send em letter  
I said I know Fivio and shorty got wetter 

Niggas know I’ma go  
I’m stomp every step 
They like B-Lovee you different 
He not like the rest 
Come straight from the jects 
Where they put shit to rest  
He gon end up like Yus  
with a whole in his chest 
Put bro on his ass 
Told him shot every step 
Give a fuck what they say 
Bitch I feel like a vet 
I ain’t dodging no smoke  
Bitch I’m one for the wreck 
Put a shot through a coat 
Bet it knock of the dress 

It’s a party but I’m on different 
On my hip glocky or the smith and 
Too much money 
I be shitting 
I'm too sleazy 
nigga I’ma get it  

Let em put him on a stretch  
Tryna play like he cool 
Put a hole in his brain 
Fuck a name  
Now he food 
Opps in the spot  
Get to shaking the room gra 
Now tryna put what’s his name on the news 

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They rolling 

Yeah 
Aye ugh 
I ride spinners  
If you a bad bitch, won't buy ya dinner 
Later on I’m diving in her 
They shooting shit like Kawaii Leonard 
None of my bitches wear make up  
Keep the mac with me no Kylie Jenner 
You gon need some damn cosmetics 
Cuz my young niggas get so aggressive 
That choppa singing like Snoe Allegra  
Man I really need to get my shit together 
I’ve been laying low and I’ve been getting cheddar 
Like that Drake song I want that shit forever 
Aye free the lil nigga Kay Flock 
Been a real nigga since the age five 
Back in high school I saw the trey five  
Yeah I was in the crib listening to based god 
Me and my nigga Dougie B live in luxury 
Come and fuck with me 
My little cousin Ty live in the bronx  
So I don’t ever stay at the Double Tree 
Back in high school i had a’s and b’s 
Now all my hoes got double D’s 
Got another cousin that stay in New York 
And he say this shit is really like the jungle b 
I’m a real nigga can’t humble me  
Can’t quiet me, they admire me 
And lately I’ve been popping mad bars 
Cuz they fame shit give me anxiety 
And all these niggas claim they want smoke
but whole time they practicing sobriety 
But I’m the good guy and that’s the irony 
I’m a fucking menace to society 
Lil bitch  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They don’t stop  

I’m riding spinners I’m riding spinners 
They rolling

The 2023 C8 Corvette Z06 ($189,027 in Canada, $164,505 in the US) could be well described as a feat of American engineering, but how does it compete against the pinnacle of all-wheel drive speed from Japan? Today it’s up against a Nissan GT-R Nismo ($291,998 in Canada, $210,740 in the US) and a violently modified R34 GT-R that pushes over 1000 horsepower. Will the mid-engine layout and roaring American flat-plane crank V8 be enough to overcome the legendary Nissan turbo 6? Thomas is in the Corvette, James is in the GT-R Nismo, and our friend @OriginalAuto is piloting their R34. Get ready for some loud noises. Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race! Especially when a tuned GTR is in the mix…Watch to see what happens! SUBSCRIBE! 

A huge thank you to @OriginalAuto for bringing out and piloting their R34

305,ePldSI0SGCg,2023 Honda Civic Type R vs Toyota GR Corolla // DRAG & ROLL RACE,"The 2023 Honda Civic Type R ($50,050 in Canada, $42,895 in the US) is undoubtedly one of the hottest hatches on the market today. But how does it compare in a drag race against the special-edition newcomer, the Toyota GR Corolla Morizo Edition ($59,990 in Canada, $49,990 in the US)? The front-wheel drive Civic Type R has more power and more torque, but the weight-reducing Morizo Edition makes the GR slightly lighter despite its all-wheel drive traction advantage. 

What happens when these two hot hatches line up at Willow Springs for a drag and a roll race? Will the Civic’s power advantage be enough to overcome the weight and traction advantage of the Corolla? Thomas is in the Honda and James is in the Toyota - let’s see what happens. Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race! Thanks for watching. SUBSCRIBE!

Both options come with strong horsepower numbers at 359 hp and 400 hp respectively, but the smaller 4 cylinder actually has a bit more torque. James has secretly used the company credit card to put a deposit down on a new Emira, and Thomas is learning that they will either have to take delivery, or forfeit their deposit altogether.

James and Thomas jump behind the wheel of both to experience them and discuss them inside and out. Watch and enjoy!

Huge thank you to Ceramic Pro Vaughan, who allowed us to look way more 'street' than we deserve by facilitating us on their location. https://www.instagram.com/ceramicpro_vaughan/

The package ups the top speed of the car to 290 km/h (180 mph), it adds 3-way adjustable coil overs and stiffer sway bars, and includes a smattering of comfort and stylish add-ons, such as a new exhaust system and alcantara trim bits. 

But can this fast and stylish Audi do more than impress with its looks and speed? How does it drive when pushed towards the limit? And have the suspension upgrades helped deal with the RS5’s tendency to understeer? Thomas and James dive into the RS5 Competition to find out what it’s all about. We hope you enjoy the episode!

Will the tried and true Honda be able to take down the more powerful Hyundai? Or will the Elantra N’s power and launch control advantage prove to be too much for mighty Accord Sport?

It can reach a top speed of 341 kph (212 mph) thanks to its 6.2 L supercharged V8, which stands so tall it needs a shaker hood just so it can fit.

Ferrari is progressing towards smaller displacement, hybrid engines. The F8 Tributo however, still proudly displays its 3.9L mid-engine V8 beneath an F40 inspired Lexan cover. Assisted by twin-turbos that have been designed to reduce turbo lag, a mighty 710 horsepower and 568 lb feet of torque are easily accessible by the driver. But how is it to drive on a canyon road?

374,gbEpI1J02Zg,Trevor Bauer on Why MLB's New Rules Are CONFUSING!,"In case you missed it last week 😂, MLB came out with their memo on foreign substance enforcement and there are some major issues with it, starting with it coming out in mid-season.  I did a little demonstration for y'all on how sticky a ball can get with just water and rosin so y’all can see for yourselves.  

Other than that, I had a great week last week: McLaren shoot, Dodgers returned to full capacity at home, Buster brought me a cake, and then we hit the hot tub before my first night of a new sleep study I'm doing.

https://nextbeat.co/r/GQXM/1

So I saw this sushi ""bazooka"" machine on Amazon and thought we had to try it out! It claims to be able to help beginners make perfect sushi rolls with any type of ingredients they want. So we decided to make a classic california roll, a fruit ""frushi"" roll, and a flaming hot cheeto spicy tuna roll. What do you think? Would you try this?

387,gPM8MxcAmkU,Trying Recipes Gordon Ramsay Hates • Peanut Butter Steak,"Hello friends! And welcome back to this channel!

This week we’re gonna be trying out a recipe (or dare I say, ""hack"") that Gordon Ramsay has gone absolutely ballistic over on his TikTok: a T-Bone steak slathered in peanut butter. We’re here to find out if it really is as awful as Gordon seems to think it is or if this recipe will pleasantly surprise us!

Yes, we know this is not how you're supposed to cook an actual steak, and yes, we know that the peanut butter jar we used is already contaminated even though we didn't spoon the stuff from the pan back in the jar! We had to retire the jar after this video. 

Gordon Ramsay’s TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTdQJDD3t/

In order to get into the holiday spirit, today we’re gonna be attempting to make a figgy pudding recipe from the 19th century! Because we've heard the carol, but we've never tasted the pudding. We’re following the recipe that Max Miller used on Tasting History from 1845 and it’s a two day process - but hopefully it’ll be worth it in the end!

Lyrics (Spanish)
Se pinta los Labios
Hoy no tiene horario
Quiere que la busque en el lambo

Esta noche coronamos
Dale
Parate terminar lo que empezamos

Baila morena
Baila morena

Baila morena
Baila morena

Baila morena 
Baila morena

Una nena asi me hacia falta
Que metiera mi mano por su falda
Se ve que no es santa
Es como yo que le gusta la maldad

Dale baby no seas mala
No pares de moverte que eso me encanta
Babysita dame una, 
una probaita 
Tu eres una mamacita

Cuando chingamos baby tu nunca te quitas
Mueve to ese b0oty tan chulita como anita
Tu estas dura

Dame tequila no quiero vaina
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua
Quiero “maninanini yaya”
Traime tequila no quiero baina 
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua

Ponte freaky, freakytona 
Tu eres una chapa chapeadora
Ella es bellaquisima pero no se enamora
Mi chingamos hay que darte un diploma
Ninguna se te iguala 
Ella me dice vente papi me la saca 
Ella Es mala flow shakira waka waka
Ella tiene el culo bello pero es flaca 
La baby flaca 

Quiero manina nini yaya
Dame tequila no quiero vaina
Baila le subo la mini ya ya 
Traime bebida no quiero agua

La baby esta borracha 
Rakata x8
Mami 
ta x25

Quiero manina nini yaya
Dame tequila no quiero vaina

We even fostered a sick puppy from Baja in 2019 and drove him back up to Canada where he's happily lived in his furever home for the last 4 years. So, when we met Alex and he said it was his dream to start a dog rescue here in Baja we knew we needed to help! 🐶 🐕 🐩

Kara & Nate have been living out of their sprinter van since last year while we've lived in and out of DIY van builds since 2017. So, we thought it would be fun to trade vans for 24 hours to see what we love, hate and admire about each other's van layouts. The ultimate #vanlife showdown 🚐 vs. 🚐 !!!!

Hi Everyone 👋   We're Eamon and Bec. In 2017 we bought our first sprinter van and spent 30 days renovating it into our dream tiny home. The plan was to van life around the world and we'd made it all the way from Canada to Africa. Fast forward to COVID...us abandoning our van in a Moroccan parking lot, flying home to Canada, converting yet another van, and then moving to our cabin in the woods. We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international van life travels. Our return to van life is in the near future but before we fly to Morocco we wanted to have a little fun with Kara & Nate.

But, everything's a mess 😳 To get a 1 year supply of Vitamin D + 5 individual travel packs FREE with your first purchase, go to https://athleticgreens.com/eamonandbec

The first time we abandoned this van was in March of 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. We returned at the end of 2021 to find our tiny home parked exactly as we’d left it (much to our surprise!). We began our victory lap through Morocco and flew home for what we thought would be a quick breast surgery… turns out I had stage 3 breast cancer. 

You can get caught up on our breast cancer journey here: https://bit.ly/3E1ORZI

In 2017 we bought our first sprinter van and spent 30 days renovating it into our dream tiny home. The plan was to van life around the world and we'd made it all the way from Canada to Africa. Fast forward to COVID...us abandoning our van in a Moroccan parking lot, flying home to Canada, converting yet another van, and then moving to our cabin in the woods.

We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international van life travels. With our sights set on returning to Morocco (after this hard year of cancer treatment), we thought it was time we dust off our van life skills. So, we squeeze 4 people into our sprinter van conversion for 48 hours!",2022-10-23 14:55:12+00:00,3901.8416854252782,17,Eamon & Bec,UC4laAHbk8VSgmvB47tsd2XQ,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vNXwcg03Bsg/default.jpg,120,90,1605,hd,true,608067,23177,0,2105,"👋🏻 we’re Eamon & Bec

466,-fEGC5gTQ18,WHAT HAS HE DONE!? Tavarish Bought the INFAMOUS Flood Damage McLaren P1,"There's crazy, and then there's what @tavarish has gone and done! Freddy has bought the infamous flood damaged McLaren P1, and my goodness does he have his work cut out to bring this back to the road. Let's head over in his re-built 675LT to go check it out... Oh boy!

I first visited Freddy when he had just bought the crash damaged 675LT, and in fact it had certainly seen better days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9kf5t5PWDA However, fast forward and it's had a total overhaul, been brough back to life, and has numerous totally unique features.

Observant viewers will notice that unfortunately this 675LT has since rather blown up... to put it lightly. Hopefully it's easy enough to work out that this was filmed beforehand and held back to reveal the P1 once Freddy had taken the wraps off to the world! More about all of that on @tavarish's channel.

However, today is all about the P1, the most infamous P1 in the world. The car that was destroyed by the hurricane in Florida last September, seem by millions in videos and images being battered around the owner's garage in flood water, sailing off down the street, and coming to a rest atop a toilet. Of course that was a devastating event and sadly many lost lives in the brutal weather, however it's Freddy's goal to get this car back on the road one day.

When it comes to a rebuild project, it's safe to say that this must be the biggest undertaking ever seen in this space. Not only has the car been entirely submerged, but every body panel has taken a battering, and absolutely nothing works as it should. I have no idea how he's going to manage, but I can't wait to see it finished!

A huge congratulations to Freddy on this massive brave pill he's swallowed, it's going to be quite the ride:

467,CBAbD9PD24g,COMPLETE TOUR of My Car Collection! 2023; 13 Years of YouTube,"Welcome to a full walk through of my entire car collection! We'll run through everything; hypercars, supercars, project cars, showcars, hot hatches and everything in between, with all of the details about age, mileage and maintenance costs as we go.

The Shmeemobiles as they are known, have been showcased over the years through the content on both the @Shmee150 and @TheShmuseum channels, but never before have I done a complete walkaround of all the cars in detail, with their stories, unique details, and maintenance costs. It's rare to have quite such a high percentage of the collection all together at the same time, so it's the perfect opportunity to dive into some of the details and stories that went into each particular car.

Inspired by @AdamLZ and @TheStradman's overviews of their collections, hopefully this can act as a resource with sections on each of the cars; why they are in the colours they are, and all the modifications and changes that have gone into each one of them. With a broad variety of manufacturers present in the line-up, and the cars stacked up on the BendPak Autostackers, there's a lot to go through!

I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey, especially those who have been here from the earlier years and even beyond the eldest of the cars in the garage. This has been quite the journey since the first Shmee150 video almost exactly 13 years ago, and there has been more than a video a day since then on average.

Thanks for watching, Tim

468,iG-rJF2rq5U,"Meet HapyHipi, the MOST ECCENTRIC Collector in the World!","HapyHipi's garage and collection is the most eccentric you will ever see! Join me with Tim for a special visit to discover the eclectic cars, through to the most incredible private toy rooms in the world, and the brand new building in construction. This private garage is like no other!

I have honestly never visited anywhere quite like the fabulous purpose built buildings found here; from the cars that are contained within to everything else that joins them. The cars themselves include a red carbon Bugatti Chiron that's been driven at 261mph, to a matching pair of green carbon McLarens with the P1 and Senna. The collection extends to featuring numerous modified supercars, muscle cars, classic American cars and plenty more as we head through the various locations.

Tim very kindly takes us on a full tour of the original building, through to the new HapyHipi Town that is under construction, which honestly will take your breath away. Along the way we can discover the collections of gas pumps, signs, Hot Wheels, model cars, and anything you can think of. Wherever you look there's something new to take in and to appreciate, whether it's the Coca-Cola memorabilia, or the set of figures of Evel Knievel.

Words cannot really explain this experience. Tim's completely unique style is unleashed with no holds barred throughout, from the colours and style, to the ideas and creations he comes up with. This is the result of a man who is not afraid to challenge the norms and follow his imagination, and that is just immense to see. I cannot thank Tim and his wife enough for hosting our visit to their fabulous location, and the time taken to share this with you.

After checking out the trio of Murcis, Spkyer and Lusso, we've got to get the $1m+ bull out onto the road, let's go!

We'll start our tour by admiring Ed's two gated manual Lamborghini Murcielagos. These are truly works of automotive art, two of the rarest version of Murcielagos out there in their respective forms. Next, we'll check out Ed's Ferrari GTC4Lusso and Spyker C8, two more examples of the incredible craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into creating a truly world-class supercar. Whether you're a fan of Italian or Dutch engineering, there's no denying the beauty and performance of these machines.

But the highlight of our tour is yet to come. we've chosen Ed's Lamborghini Murcielago SV for us to take for a spin, to experience the full rawness of this limited edition supercar. With Ed at the wheel, let's learn a little more about the Murcielago and in particular the information that he's learned about the car thanks to a network of enthusiasts. Then it's my turn to get behind the wheel and be reminded how little sense the Murci really makes, but yet how perfect it is anyway!

So join along as we explore Ed Bolian's supercar garage and experience the thrill of driving his Lamborghini Murcielago SV. It's always a pleasure to catch up with Ed in Atlanta, so be sure to also check out my latest stories on the @VINwiki channel too!

470,CBAbD9PD24g,COMPLETE TOUR of My Car Collection! 2023; 13 Years of YouTube,"Welcome to a full walk through of my entire car collection! We'll run through everything; hypercars, supercars, project cars, showcars, hot hatches and everything in between, with all of the details about age, mileage and maintenance costs as we go.

The Shmeemobiles as they are known, have been showcased over the years through the content on both the @Shmee150 and @TheShmuseum channels, but never before have I done a complete walkaround of all the cars in detail, with their stories, unique details, and maintenance costs. It's rare to have quite such a high percentage of the collection all together at the same time, so it's the perfect opportunity to dive into some of the details and stories that went into each particular car.

Inspired by @AdamLZ and @TheStradman's overviews of their collections, hopefully this can act as a resource with sections on each of the cars; why they are in the colours they are, and all the modifications and changes that have gone into each one of them. With a broad variety of manufacturers present in the line-up, and the cars stacked up on the BendPak Autostackers, there's a lot to go through!

I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey, especially those who have been here from the earlier years and even beyond the eldest of the cars in the garage. This has been quite the journey since the first Shmee150 video almost exactly 13 years ago, and there has been more than a video a day since then on average.

Thanks for watching, Tim

471,JDVLWPnKJj8,My DREAM FIRST DRIVE in the New LAMBORGHINI COUNTACH!,"I can't believe this day from my dreams! Join me for my first drive with the new Lamborghini Countach LPI800-4; the latest few-off series hypercar. I'm at the Lamborghini factory for a full experience of what the car is all about, heading up into the Italian mountains. Let's go!

Limited to only 112 customer cars, linking to the LP112 codename of the original Countach, this particular example is car 0, that Lamborghini have very kindly taken out from the Museum for this opportunity to share with you what it's all about. Following on the heels of the Reventon, Veneno, Centenario and Sian, it's the latest road going model from the series that also includes the track-only Sesto Elemento.

Powered by a 6.5l NA V12 with Lamborghini's Supercapacitor system that was introduced with the Sian and Sian Roadster, the Countach offers up 814hp and a top speed in excess of 355km/h (221mph). However, this is a car that tells an emotional story, 50 years after the first concept Countach was launched back in 1972; a model that lasted 16 years in production and set a very high bar for iconic supercars.

Visually, the new Countach features design elements from the likes of the P400/P500, Periscopio, 5000 Quattrovalvole, and 25th Anniversary editions of the original, while being based on the platform of the Aventador, which itself is soon to be superceded by a long-awaited new model. In many ways it's the last of an era, the last special vehicle on this platform, and one that brings a glorious heritage no with it.

This particular car is finished in Bianco Siderale over a red heritage interior; inspired by the spec of the very Countach owned by Ferruccio Lamborghini himself at the time. After taking a full walkaround to go through the specification and understand the details of the car, it's time to head into the hills to find some stunning scenery with the hills blanketed in a layer of snow. This is absolutely a day from my dreams; the car, location, experience, thank you to Lamborghini!

Thanks for watching, Tim

Polar Peak is one of the new named locations introduced in season 7 of Fortnite Battle Royale. This location started out as cold as ice, but soon things started to heat up with the winter iteration of the zombies returning. That's right, these drops take place mostly during the ice storm event, also known as snowy Fortnitemares. Watch as I conquer the melting Polar Peak and take on the frosty zombies.

The film also stars Adriana Barraza, Damían Alcázar, Elpidia Carrillo, Bruna Marquezine, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, George Lopez, Belissa Escobedo, and Harvey Guillén.

Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it.

When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero Blue Beetle. 

Angel Manuel Soto directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, based on characters from DC. John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.

Blue Beetle opens in theaters internationally beginning August 2023 and in North America on August 18, 2023.

The film also stars Adriana Barraza, Damían Alcázar, Elpidia Carrillo, Bruna Marquezine, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, George Lopez, Belissa Escobedo, and Harvey Guillén.

Recent college grad Jaime Reyes returns home full of aspirations for his future, only to find that home is not quite as he left it.

When the Scarab suddenly chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, he is bestowed with an incredible suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the Super Hero Blue Beetle. 

Angel Manuel Soto directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, based on characters from DC. John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.

The film also stars Belissa Escobedo (“American Horror Stories,” “Hocus Pocus 2”) and Harvey Guillén (“What We Do in the Shadows”). Soto (“Charm City Kings,” “The Farm”) directs from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer (“Miss Bala”), based on characters from DC.

John Rickard and Zev Foreman are producing, with Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Garrett Grant serving as executive producers.

The director’s creative team behind the scenes includes director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski (“Midsommar,” “Hereditary”), production designer John Billington (“Bad Boys for Life”), editor Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “The Lost City”), Oscar-nominated costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (“Jojo Rabbit,” the “Thor” films), visual effects supervisor Kelvin McIlwain (“The Suicide Squad,” “Aquaman”) and composer Bobby Krlic (“Midsommar,” the “Snowpiercer” series).

577,0OGN0ZBzNWM,Blue Beetle Origin - Sentient Alien Scarab Latches A Body To Create DC's Most Interesting Superhero,"You know, in a world filled with super-powered gorillas, rage-fueled cosmic cats, and a flying dog whose name probably inspired the digital currency of the “metaverse”, a magical, ancient scarab actually sounds rather commonplace. But this is a comic book character we’re talking about, so it would be surprising if Blue Beetle didn’t have a convoluted backstory. The character actually originated in 1939, as the featured superhero of Fox’s short-lived comic book publication house. Debuting in The Mystery Men issue #1, Dan Garret was a regular cop by day and the masked, investigative vigilante known as Blue Beetle by night. In other words, he was basically Fox’s version of Batman, except he wasn’t all that rich and his increased strength & agility came from a secret formula called Vitamin 2X. Over time, the Blue Beetle evolved into a more traditional Golden Age superhero and was given his own series. But Fox soon went out of business, and then Charlton Comics- who had obtained the rights to Blue Beetle- sold its entire gallery of supers to DC Comics in 1983, which is how the character ended up traveling from “Earth 4” to the main DC continuity during “Crises on Infinite Earths”. Since then, he’s become one of its most-influential characters, becoming possibly the best DC superhero outside of the Justice League. But what is Blue Beetle all about? And how did he go from literal obscurity to becoming an inspiration for Alan Moore’s Watchmen? This video will answer all that, and more; this is Blue Beetle’s Origins – Explored.

Since James Gunn and Peter Safran are heading up DC Studios and that WBD CEO David Zaslav once again mentions Superman needing to happen, my guess is that new Henry Cavill Superman will be in development next year.

An enormous thanks to Prof. Steven Strogatz — this video would not have been possible without him. Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to. His Podcast ""The Joy of X"" is wonderful — please listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-x

Apparently religion is on the decline in the United States

However, it’s still very difficult for a political candidate today to get elected if they are not religious. In fact, candidates often hype up how religious they are by making sure media outlets know when they are going to church. See! Look at me! I’m going to church! I’m a good boy!

The current U.S. President, Joe Biden, identifies as a Roman Catholic, making him only the second American President in history to be Catholic.

Article 6, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution says you can’t be forced to take a religious test in order to hold a government position, but obviously, voters can be biased against or for candidates based on their religion. 

In this video, I’m going to briefly look at the religion of every President in American history, and some of them might just surprise you.

Canada and The United States of America

The two biggest countries in North America

Both have a lot in common... 

Woah, are we really gonna do this? Ok, let’s do this…

Both have very close cultural and economic ties. 

So actually, both are two of the biggest countries in the world. Canada is slightly bigger than the United States. 

Both share the world’s longest border between two countries. The border stretches 5,525 miles….or...I mean, 8,891 kilometers. Yeah while Canada has officially adopted the metric system as a whole, the United States is only one of three countries in the entire world that hasn’t. That said, plenty of Canadians don’t always use the metric system to measure stuff, and plenty of Americans do often use the metric system.

Anyway, let’s stick with more similarities first, ok?

Both are two of the wealthiest, most developed countries in the world. Immigrants have flocked to both countries for economic opportunity for centuries, which is why major cities in both are some of the mostly ethnically diverse in the world. 

Both have mixed economies and have a progressive tax system on income. However, Canadians definitely pay higher taxes overall.

Oh lots of trading be going on between the two. The United States is Canada’s largest trading partner, and Canada is consistently a top three trading partner for the United States. Both are in NATO and have historically fought as allies in wars.

Both have lots of natural resources. Both have a wide variety of climates and rainfall patterns.

Both are democratic. Specifically, the United States is a democratic republic, and Canada is a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. 

Both are growing at about the same rate. (C- .7%, US- .8%)

Residents of both generally like their space. Indeed, everything is more spread out in both countries.",2020-12-11 15:59:56+00:00,20244.76279653639,18,Mr. Beat,UCmYesELO6axBrCuSpf7S9DQ,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUz_0DM7F48/default.jpg,120,90,1363,hd,true,2040061,35135,0,9134,"For all sponsorship inquiries, please contact me at mrbeat@algebramedia.com

630,A7cWtICGgHE,Why There Are NO Penguins in the Arctic | Island Biogeography 2,"Part two of three! Penguins are some of the most popular animals on the planet thanks to their outstanding ability to survive in at the south pole. But what about the north pole? Surely with a similar climate, penguins should be able thrive in the Arctic just as they do in the Antarctic, but, well, they don't. To understand why this is, we need to take a closer look at these amazing birds!

In just a few short years, Japan’s Superconducting Maglev (SCMaglev) will become the world’s fastest train in operation. Traveling at near aircraft-like speeds of 503km per hour, the SCMaglev will eventually link Japan’s population centers of Tokyo and Osaka in just 67 Minutes.
 
The SCMaglev will operate on the Chuo Shinkansen, a new 438km intercity route connecting Tokyo to Osaka. The line will run right through a mountain range, requiring the vast majority of the route to run in tunnels. However, the Chuo Shinkansen will be more direct than the current Shinkansen high-speed rail route. The first section is expected to open in 2027 with the remaining connection to Osaka completed a decade later in 2037

The SCMaglev will be the world’s first superconducting maglev to enter service. To levitate trains off their guideway, electromagnets are cooled to extreme temperatures in order to take advantage of a phenomenon called superconductivity. The electromagnets on board the train interact with two sets of coils embedded inside a guideway, one to propel the train and the other levitation and guidance. The low electrical resistance in superconducting magnets allows SCMaglevs to consume 30% less energy than other high-speed maglev trains, like Germany’s Transrapid.
  
The technology behind SCMaglev is nearly 60 years in the making. But the Chuo Shinkansen is also one of the most expensive transport projects in history and an enormous bet on high-speed maglev, a technology that has yet to prove itself. Given the enormous costs and move away from proven high-speed rail technologies, some question whether building the world's fastest train really makes sense.

Listen / by Beyonce
和訳: ジェフ

Listen to the song here in my heart
(聞いて 心からの歌)
a melody I start but can't complete
(まだ終われない歌声を)
Listen to the sound from deep within
(聞いて 始まりの音)
Its only beginning to find release
(心は出口を探してる)
Ohh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
(夢を語るときがきた)
They will not be pushed aside and turned　
(誰にも押されず)
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
(あなたの心で 聞いて)

Listen I am alone at a crossroads, I'm not at home 
(聞いて 家を出て 独りここに立ち)
in my own home
(変わらず)
And I've tried and tried　To say whats on my mind
(気持ちを言葉にしている)
You should have known
(そこにも届くかな)

Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
(いまは信じてほしい 感じるんだ)
I'm more than what　You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
(縛られてきたけどこの声を信じるよ)
But now I've gotta find my own

He put together a great all-around performance in this series to cap off one of the best postseason runs of his career at just 22 years old. The Lakers also punctuated one of the most dominant Playoff runs in NBA history, finishing with a postseason record of 15-1. This was the highest Playoff winning percentage for a championship-winning team in the history of the league up to that point, remaining the best until the 2017 Warriors went 16-1.

2009 Western Conference Finals Game 3, May 23, 2009 | One of my favorite playoff performances by Kobe. There was uncertainty with the Lakers after they lost game 2 at home to go to Denver, one of the toughest places to play for opposing teams, in a tied series. Kobe had that look all night long and you knew he was all business from the opening jump. He poured in 41 points, none bigger than his dagger three over JR Smith to put the Lakers up 1 with just over a minute remaining. The Lakers wouldn't look back after that three, ending the game on a 10-2 run to win the game and take back the series lead at 2-1.

''On tonight's 'ACM Girls Night Out' CBS special, Ronnie Dunn serenaded Sugarland singer Jennifer Nettles with one of her own songs, the 2007 platinum hit, 'Stay.'

""Jennifer, my love,"" Dunn said as he took the microphone. ""You've been an incredible friend to me, and it's an honor to sing this song tonight. I hope I can do it justice.""

Nettles was invited to the event to be honored as one of only two female artists in the academy's history to ever write and perform the winning Song of the Year for 'Stay,' an achievement that she alone can take credit for. She sat perched in her throne at the side of the stage and watched as her country music peer, formerly of Brooks and Dunn, poured out the same emotion that she put into the song originally.

Though, Dunn's unique male touch gave an entirely new element to the song, and the 'Bleed Red' soloist received applause from both the audience and Nettles as he drew the last note.

""Thank you so much, that was really, really beautiful,"" Nettles said to Dunn, still in awe. ""It's wonderful to be included in such beautiful -- and talented -- company. That was great.""

Tonight's event honored female artists the Judds, Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Loretta Lynn and Carrie Underwood -- as well as Nettles -- for their great achievements  in the industry.''

""Thank you so much, that was really, really beautiful,"" Nettles said to Dunn, still in awe. ""It's wonderful to be included in such beautiful -- and talented -- company. That was great.""

Tonight's event honored female artists the Judds, Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Loretta Lynn and Carrie Underwood -- as well as Nettles -- for their great achievements  in the industry.''

Tom Nardone is an example of pursuing the American Dream of financial freedom. At age 19, he started working for the Post Office as a mailman. It didn’t take him long to realize that the security entrapment of “good job” is not a lot different from a 30 year jail sentence. “You feel trapped, and your income is limited.” Realizing his “good government job” was not going to make his dreams of being financially free come true, Tom took some real estate investing courses and bought his first house in 1983 at just 23 years old. Shortly thereafter he recognized a valuable asset available to him that his real estate investor competition did not have. 

Tom shares his out-of-the-box thinking and real-life real estate investing experiences by mentoring real estate Investors to reach their dreams of financial freedom. Visit http://www.tomnardonemillionairemailman.com for more information.",2008-09-02 03:25:41+00:00,5327.0555849619095,238660,121,638

From Ken Ehrlich, veteran executive producer of the Grammy Awards and a multi-Emmy Award nominee, the two-hour special will feature an all-star group of music superstars who will pay tribute to Elvis, recreating the spectacle - even the staging - of that legendary night. Elvis' December 3, 1968 special was his first live television performance since 1961 and a monumental television event. Dressed in a black leather jumpsuit and playing with a full band in front of an intimate audience, the telecast was hugely popular and was, in fact, the No. 1-rated show on NBC that season. In addition to musical performances, the special will showcase rare Elvis footage, outtakes and interviews from those involved in the special, including Director Steve Binder. Whether you're a lifelong fan or just getting to know Elvis, this is an event not to be missed. ""Elvis All-Star Tribute"" is executive produced by Ken Ehrlich and produced by Ken Ehrlich Productions.

If you want to find one of these creators, search them up either on twitch.tv or YouTube. Nametags for every creator is listed on the screen of their clip so make sure to check them out!

Please note: On Gamers React, you will discover highly edited gaming clips from streamers. Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the person’s speech or have some other kind of edit). Creative sound effects like cartoon effects when someone either falls from a high place, hits the ground, falls in lava, dies in the game, and much more. We include many memes in the video to make the video more entertaining for the viewer to watch as well as include many green screen effects to make the videos more comical and creative. We also spend time zooming in on peoples faces as well as zooming into certain parts of the video to highlight something the viewer may be missing out on if there were no zoom ins. We also manipulate audio or video in our clips to ensure there is no dead air for our viewers to watch. Over 50 clips are used in every video and we come up with a creative way to alter EVERY SINGLE clip to make it our own and UNIQUE to OUR channel. The majority of the unedited (or original) version of the clips I use can NOT be found anywhere else on YouTube.

The undefeated Davis (20-0, 19 KOs) scored three knockdowns in less than three rounds to win his second title in the super featherweight division. The 23-year-old connected on 49 percent of his power shots in his first bout with new trainer Kevin Cunningham.

Davis utilized a combination of body shots, uppercuts and effective counterpunching to break down Cuellar, a former titlist at 126-pounds. Baltimore's Davis floored Cuellar with a body blow in the second round and didn't relent from there. The southpaw pressed forward in the third, stalking Cuellar against the ropes and sending him down for the second time with a series of combinations. Cuellar (28-3, 21 KOs) got up, but was in serious trouble and referee Benjy Esteves stepped in to halt the contest at 2:45 with the Argentine falling to the canvas for the third time.

740,wDRdK392pnk,"Garcia vs Porter FULL FIGHT: September 8, 2018 | PBC on Showtime","Shawn Porter became WBC Welterweight World Champion Saturday night as he earned a narrow unanimous decision victory over Danny Garcia in a hotly contested fight live on SHOWTIME from Barclays Center the home of BROOKLYN BOXING™, in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions.

All three judges scored the fight in favor of Porter (116-112, 115-113, 115-113) in an electrifying fight in front of 13,058 fans at the 30th professional boxing event at Barclays Center. 

Porter earned the belt that Keith Thurman, who previously defeated Porter and Garcia, was forced to vacate due to an injury.

In an anticipated title fight that was widely regarded as a 50-50 contest in boxing's deepest division, Garcia vs. Porter played out as advertised. The difference in total power punches landed throughout the 12-round battle was just five, with Garcia holding the narrow advantage.

In a matchup of accuracy vs. activity, Porter looked to outworked Garcia. He was relentless in his attack and threw 742 total punches and 544 power punches, landing 25 percent. Garcia, on the other hand, was the more precise fighter, landing the higher percentage and more meaningful punches. He connected on 46 percent of the 304 power punches he threw. Due to the contrasting styles, the three judges were only able to all agree on four rounds.

""I made a prediction and a hard one to live up to,"" said Porter. ""I said I wasn't leaving New York without this belt and I'm not leaving New York without this belt.

""I knew he was going to be accurate. The game plan for me was to be accurate from the outside and show I could beat him without roughing him up on the ropes.""

A disappointed Garcia clearly disagreed with the judges' scorecards.

""He was throwing a lot,"" said Garcia, who falls to 7-2 in world title fights. ""I had my defense tight, so I wasn't feeling his punches. I thought I landed the clearer shots and won this fight.

""I have to sit back, relax and see what's next for me.""

741,vxw3x1zVvEE,"Fury vs Wilder 3 FULL FIGHT: October 9, 2021 | PBC on FOX PPV","(Oct. 9, 2021) In an incredible back-and-forth that included five knockdowns and countless exchanges, Tyson Fury retained his WBC Heavyweight World Title and lineal crown with an eleventh-round TKO win over former long-time champion Deontay Wilder in an ESPN+/FOX Sports pay-per-view live from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

The UK’s Fury (31-0-1, 22 KOs) scored three knockdowns in all, the final two in the eleventh frame, sending the raucous crowd of 15,820 into a frenzy.

Fury got off to a hot start in the first round, landing quick one-two’s while Wilder worked the jab to the body. A hard right toward the end of the round punctuated it for Fury, as did another in the second.

The action heated up in the third when a big Fury right sent Wilder tumbling to the canvas. The game slugger from Tuscaloosa, Alabama rose to his feet, surviving the follow-up until the bell rang moments later.

With Wilder (42-2-1, 41 KOs) on unsteady legs in the fourth, Fury pounced, looking to finish him off. But just when it appeared that the fight was about to end, the “Bronze Bomber” uncorked a perfect short right followed by another, driving Fury to the mat.

Fury made it to his feet but was down again moments later when another Wilder flurry floored him. The bell rang seconds after he got up.

Wilder started strong in the fifth, blasting Fury with more rights. The “Gypsy King” maintained his composure, digging to the body in close quarters.

The inside work slowly wore Wilder down. He was dropped again in the tenth from another Fury right and then a third and final time in the eleventh via a crunching right cross. Referee Russell Mora mercifully rescued the brave warrior, ending the fight at 1:10 of the round.

742,2AtlEV2KBmU,Joshua vs Franklin FULL FIGHT HIGHLIGHTS 🥊 #BANTAMentertainment,"Former two-time heavyweight boxing
champion ANTHONY JOSHUA managed to
clinch a win after a less-than-stellar performance
in a unanimous points victory over JERMAINE FRANKLIN. 

The British fighter lost three of his last five
contests, including consecutive losses to
Oleksandr Usyk. 

""I would have liked a knockout, but it's
important to get the win,"" Joshua said.
He regularly landed with his left jab and
caught Franklin several times with his powerful
right. 

A bizarre finish saw the 12th round appearing to
end eight seconds early before Joshua pushed his
head into Franklin.

Judges scored the fight 117-111, 117-111, and 118-111 for Joshua, who snaps a two-fight losing skid with the victory. Bad Left Hook unofficially scored the bout 118-110 for Joshua.

Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content.

805,TGD8zKvRxc4,Harry Potter By Balenciaga | Step by Step Tutorial,"Here is How to make Harry Potter by Balenciaga Video:
The actual video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N8RX3lIQDU


Lets start:

🔹 Generate the image prompts with ChatGPT 

ChatGPT - https://chat.openai.com/chat
ChatGPT prompts: 

1. ""Give me the 10 most popular Harry Potter characters, just the names.""

2.  ""Now, act as a Balenciaga fashion designer with 20 years of experience. I want you to dress each of these 10 characters in a unique Balenciaga piece for a runway show. Just write the name of the character and the piece. Remember, it's a 1990 fashion show.""

3.  ""Ok, now this is a prompt that I use to generate images from another AI image generation tool called Midjourney: '1990 screengrab of female model Hermione Granger wearing a grotesque black Balenciaga dress, fashion movie scene, Balenciaga commercial --ar 3:2 --v 5'. Just say 'Y' if you understand.""

4. ""I want you to rewrite the prompt but for every character, with the clothes you chose for them. Remember to write the prompt exactly as I pasted it, with the same format and parameters. Only change the gender of the model, the name of the character, and the description of the clothing. Do you understand? Please ask if you need more information.""

Friends, today we’re taking a dive into the dark world of Doors. One of Roblox's most successful horror games, and boy is it RIPE for the picking. There's lore being seeded here that I think will pay off big time for the HOTEL + Update. So come on in and remember, no matter what you do… DON’T open the door.

Theorists, we all know I love a good ARG. And Crow 64? Well, I had to dive in head first. Crow 64 is the ARG of the ""unfinished Nintendo 64 game"" called Catastrophe Crow. In the original video, we get the history of the game as well as our first playthrough footage. From there, it spread across the internet into a building mystery waiting to be figured out. Today, I am going to try to do just that.

837,ZQDCusHa6yY,Secrets of Gobekli Tepe: Unlocking the Mysteries of Prehistoric Human Events,"Göbekli Tepe is an archaeological site located in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. It is considered to be one of the oldest and most important archaeological sites in the world, with a history dating back to the Neolithic period. The site contains a series of circular and oval-shaped structures made of limestone, which were constructed by hunter-gatherers around 11,000 years ago. 

The discovery of Göbekli Tepe has forced researchers to rethink the way they view the transition from foraging to farming societies and the origins of human civilization. The site provides valuable insights into the social organization, religion, and technology of ancient human communities and its discoveries are still ongoing.

Get the Map of Black Holes poster and Professor Astro Cat books here: https://store.dftba.com/collections/domain-of-science
This is the Map of Black Holes which isn’t a map of where all the black holes are in space, it’s a concept map of the subject of black holes: laying out our current knowledge of them. Their structure including Schwarzschild radius or event horizon, the singularity, photon sphere, innermost stable orbit, accretion disk, Hawking radiation and the difference between rotating and non-rotating black holes. I also look at the evidence for their existence, the many ways we have detected them though x-ray astronomy, gravitational wave astronomy and radio astronomy. Then the many outstanding mysteries still to be solved including wormholes, the holographic theory and information paradox. They are very fascinating objects indeed.

The Truth About the Trolley Problem 

The trolley problem has become  almost cliche as a use of philosophy in pop culture. But why are we so fixated on hypothetical ethical dilemmas? And does thinking them through actually teach us anything? Or is the trolley problem just kind of a joke? Let’s find out in this Wisecrack Edition: The Trolley Problem: Deep or Dumb?

A bear? Or a cat?

It's a black panther!

She was abandoned by her own mother at a zoo in Siberia.

Victoria who had an experience in raising a big cat took her in and named her Luna. Luna grew up with Victoria's love.

Then Luna met a Rottweiler Venza. Venza thought she was her own child and started taking care of her gently. 

Just like a dog & a cat, their bond have been built and their friendship has been dynamic.

First visit this year by your favorite girl, Simone! AND YES, SHE BROUGHT HER FIRST EVER LITTER OF CUBS!!!! 

The collar is gone - nice! - and she looks well-fed. The cubs are the cutest things to ever have walked these woods, but then I'm kind of biased.

My content focuses on North America, but I strive to show the larger picture and at times cover significant international events as they occur.

I was entranced with the weather when I was 4, which is when I started watching forecasts on TV for around the nation. Since then, I haven't deviated from my passion for atmospheric science:
- Graduated UNC Asheville in Spring 2021
- Started working with Ryan in March 2022
- Became a published author in the American Meteorological Society in October 2022 

Now I've started this project here where I can be a leader in a paradigm shift of social meteorology; that is, changing how you get to know your weather!

901,BowpUasB-Nw,Intense Close Range Intercept of Violent EF-4 Tornado - Iowa High Risk Tornado Outbreak - 3/31/23,"The first SPC issued ""High Risk"" (level 5/5) in over 2 years brought multiple strong-to-violent tornadoes to eastern Iowa on March 31st, 2023. This video includes footage from 2 or possibly 3 of those tornadoes, all spawned by the same parent supercell, as well as an intercept of a tornado-warned QLCS south of Iowa City, which brought large hail and high winds, along with torrential rain. Thankfully, nobody was killed from the tornadoes in Iowa. Sadly, many other areas were not as fortunate.

The close range wedge tornado featured in this video has been preliminarily rated EF-4 (violent) with maximum winds of 170 mph.

This is definitely my ""best"" chase to date, and one of the most intense moments of my life. I still cannot believe what I witnessed.

This is all after a tornado outbreak brought deadly tornadoes to Little Rock, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, and many more states, along with massive hail. North Texas could also see significant severe weather today. Additionally, another winter storm could impact the Northern USA and the Midwest this week. This could lead to several inches of snow!

913,SuTNJhV4-rg,The December 2021 Derecho And Tornado Outbreak Retrospective,"RESOURCES USED: https://pastebin.com/JayQ98UD

Thumbnail Image by Colin Lloyd via Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/@onthesearchforpineapples?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText

Edit: Turns out, some transitions into some scenes are screwed up for some reason. However, I feel like it is not worth rendering it AGAIN for 10 HOURS, to fix something as a fade out not happening. Sorry if that bothers people. 

December, a month often associated with holiday festivities and spreading the holiday joy to those around their peers. For many early on in December in 2021, that was the case, well, until two notable severe weather events occurred across the United States. The most well known event, The December 10-11 Tornado Outbreak, was known for an EF4 tornado that impacted Bowling Green, Kentucky, and a large, long-track, wedge tornado that tore through Mayfield, Kentucky and multiple towns and cities in western Kentucky during the tornado's three hour duration, travelling 165 miles. The December 10-11 Outbreak broke the record for the most tornadoes in a tornado outbreak in the month of December, and is often the most well known and talked about tornado outbreak from 2021. However this video isn't about Mayfield. It's about what happened 4 days later. 

Not even a week had passed and something just as insane as the Mayfield outbreak occurred. In the upper plains and Midwest. In December. A Derecho that became one of the most prolific severe wind events in the United States History, with only the May 12, 2022 Outbreak being in close contention for the title for the most severe wind reports from a derecho. A derecho that began much earlier than expected, travelling over 700 miles in the span of roughly 8-9 hours total, impacting states such as Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. More notably though, the record that the Mayfield Outbreak had, the most tornadoes from a single outbreak in the month of December, was broken in less than a week from this derecho, with a total of 120 tornadoes touching down across the upper plains and midwest. Not ONLY was there a threat for a Derecho and tornado outbreak, but the threat of winter weather, wildfires, and strong winds were present across all areas impacted by the severe weather. Join me, as I breakdown one of the most complex significant weather events in recent memory.

그룹 방탄소년단, BTS 멤버 지민이 솔로 음반 타이틀곡 '라이크 크레이지'로 미국 빌보드 메인 싱글 차트 '핫 100' 1위에 올랐습니다. 한국 솔로 가수로 해당 차트 1위에 오른 건 이번이 처음입니다.

남주현 기자가 전해드립니다.

〈기자〉

빌보드가 공개한 이번 주 싱글 차트 1위 곡은 방탄소년단 지민의 '라이크 크레이지'입니다.

지민은 팝스타 마일리 사이러스, 컨트리 가수 모건 월렌 등 쟁쟁한 경쟁자를 제치고 정상에 올랐습니다.

지금까지 빌보드 '핫 100'에서 1위를 한 K팝 가수는 방탄소년단이 유일해 지민은 개인, 그룹으로 모두 '핫 100' 1위 고지를 밟은 최초의 K팝 가수가 됐습니다.

솔로 가수 종전 최고 순위 곡은 2012년 2위에 올랐던 싸이의 '강남스타일'입니다.

지민은 방탄소년단이어서 가능했다며 팬들에게 고마움을 전했습니다.

[지민/방탄소년단 멤버 : 이게 방탄이라서 가능한 거고, 아미 여러분들이 있으니까 가능한 거고, 그거를 절대 모르지 않습니다.]

'라이크 크레이지'는 지민의 첫 공식 솔로 음반 타이틀곡으로, 강렬한 신시사이저·드럼 사운드에 지민의 애절한 음색이 대조를 이룬다는 평가를 받습니다.

'라이크 크레이지'는 앞서 미국 빌보드와 함께 세계 양대 차트로 꼽히는 영국 오피셜 싱글 차트 '톱 100'에는 8위로 진입했습니다.

 [리포트]

 [""lost in the light...""]

 강렬한 신시사이저와 드럼, 여기에 귀에 감기는 애절한 음색이 절묘한 대조를 이룹니다.

 그룹 방탄소년단 지민의 첫 솔로 음반 페이스의  타이틀곡인 라이크 크레이집니다.

 동명의 영화에서 영감을 받아 곡 작업에 직접 참여했다는 지민은, 상처를 잊기 위해 현실을 외면하는 순간의 감정을 표현한 곡이라고 소개한 바 있습니다.

 빌보드는 오늘 공식 트위터를 통해 이번 주 싱글 차트 핫100의 상위 10개 곡을 공개했습니다.

 여기서 쟁쟁한 노래들을 제치고 지민의 라이크 크레이지가 정상에 오른 겁니다.

 [지민/위버스/발표 직후 : ""여러분이 훨씬 자랑스럽고 방탄이 자랑스럽고 같이 작업해주신 모든 분들이 자랑스럽습니다.""]

 이전까지 빌보드 싱글 차트에서 1위를 한 K팝 가수는 솔로와 그룹을 모두 합쳐서 방탄소년단이 유일합니다.

 걷는 길이 곧 역사였던 방탄소년단은 2020년 다이너마이트를 시작으로 2021년 마이유니버스까지 총 6곡의 싱글 차트 1위 곡을 보유하고 있습니다.

 특히 지민은 개인으로 또 그룹으로도 빌보드 싱글 차트 1위를 달성한 최초의 한국 가수라는 타이틀도 갖게 됐습니다.

 지금까지 솔로 가수 중에는 싸이가 강남스타일로  7주 연속 2위를 한 게 최고 기록이었습니다.

 [지민/가수/지난달 31일/KBS2TV 뮤직뱅크 : ""많이 부족하지만 좀 느리지만 앞으로 더 열심히 천천히 더 정진해나가도록하겠습니다.""]

 한편 지민은 방탄소년단 RM과 함께 라이크 크레이지의 송라이터로 이름을 올렸습니다.

 이로써 지민은 싱글 차트 1위곡 송라이터라는 기록도 처음으로 갖게 됐고, RM은 버터, 마이 유니버스 등에 이어 4번쨉니다.

Now, it’s really there.” He closed the year with a self-released EP, Cortlandt Baby. Across six unique tracks, B flexed his range. The melodic “Hero” chronicled an unlikely path to success, while “Only One” showed a rapper with a standout flow. “People will see what you’re doing and try to do it too,” says the artist who is intent on being original and outmaneuvering the copycats. This summer, B-Lovee further separated himself from the pack with “IYKYK.” Grabbing melodic elements from Wayne Wonder’s 2003 hit “No Letting Go,” B rapped about his command of the block. In September, the seven-figure streaming song was broadcast on HOT 97 and hit Apple Music playlists, including The New New York, New In Hip Hop, and The Plug. As the track thrives on TikTok and Shazam, “IYKYK” was praised by Pitchfork and Lyrical Lemonade.

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today it’s all about color - and as someone who is known for wearing almost only black, I decided to dip my toes into the personal color analysis trend I've been hearing about for years and seeing all over TikTok. Because I've always been curious... am I a winter? Autumn? Summer? Or even Spring? Pastels have never been my forte, but I was open to at least *hearing* about them. So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I’d been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?

Also, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‌thecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process. Accurate results can only be achieved through their color analysis process!!

HELLO FRIENDS! After many weeks... here is the video that almost defeated me, the grand finale of our Vegas trip - where we ate at every celebrity chef restaurant on the Vegas strip! Now as some of you all may know, Tyler and I are big Food Network fans - and while we were in Vegas, we decided to visit one of every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip! We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?

Also, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies. If you'd like to know more, here are a couple of links to some more information -

968,UrkPC81_QfU,How Retail Stores Manipulate You,"HELLO FRIENDS!! a bit of an experimental video here, but i hope you guys like it... 

Have you ever wondered why you always get lost in IKEA? Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase! This is the first of a 3-part series we're gonna be working on throughout the year!

A big thank you to Jen Clinehens for helping us out with this video; make sure to check out her YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowLiketheGreatest

So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I’d been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?

Also, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‌thecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process. Accurate results can only be achieved through their color analysis process!!

970,d-HPZL6AU64,I Tried Following A Simply Nailogical Nail Art Tutorial,"So I saw everyone following each other's makeup tutorials and I wanted to join in, but I decided that I wanted to try something I'd never tried before: NAIL ART. So in this video I tried to follow my friend Simply Nailogical's DIY multi-chrome raindrop nail tutorial and see how it went! We used gel polish, multichrome powder, glossy top coat, and fun rain drop effects!!

Bio
Best known for founding evo magazine with a group of talented motoring journalists back in 1998 which, much to our surprise, went on to become a global player in the automotive media arena. Also wrote stuff for Octane Magazine and Sunday Times. 
Left evo in September 2013 and became an outside advisor to Jaguar Land Rover 2013-18, helping JLR set up Special Operations.  

Hooked on cars from an early age, although my first love was motorbikes, the first one arriving when I was 11. Swapped to 4-wheels when I turned 17 and have been lucky enough to have owned or driven almost every interesting car ever made. This YouTube channel is my way of sharing this passion for all things motoring with an equally passionate audience.

979,eItCv1Pxccg,I drove the most powerful BMW M car EVER!,"Meet the all-new BMW XM! 

It’s the first BMW M-exclusive SUV, and Mat’s about to find out if it’s worth the eye-watering £147,000+ price tag! 

For starters, let’s check out the design - and there’s no denying it’s certainly eye-catching! With a huge grille with horizontal slats up front, the XM looks like an absolute beast! There’s gold trim to be found from the front to the rear, and around the back, you’ll even find stacked horizontal tailpipes! 

The impressive looks continue on the inside too, with a huge curved infotainment screen, super-comfy leather sports seats, and soft-touch materials throughout the cabin. There’s even a futuristic 3D-printed headliner! 

Under the bonnet, you’ll find an almighty 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 that can produce 653hp and 800Nm of torque. Although in the future a Label Red edition is due which will produce 748hp!

So it’s all pretty impressive, right? But is it really worth around £150,000?! Stick with Mat and see for yourself!

980,CkjT_jNYI4w,New BMW M2 review with 0-60mph & auto vs manual!,"This is the all-new BMW M2! 

Mat’s headed over to America to get his hands on this all-new sports coupe, and he’s about to find out if it’s a worthy successor to the previous M2, and whether it can compete with the likes of the Porsche Cayman or even the M3! 

Well when it comes to the design, it’s had a serious overhaul over the regular 2 Series. It’s got a large squared kidney grille up front, bulging wheel arches over the side, a carbon fibre roof and quad tailpipes at the back. All-in-all, it’s certainly meaner and more aggressive than the regular 2 Series. 

It’s a similar story on the inside, with several changes made over the standard car. As you’d expect there’s a smattering of M tricolour to be found throughout, a fair bit of carbon fibre, and M-specific digital dial graphics. It also comes with sport bucket seats. 

Then let’s take a look under the bonnet! It comes with the same 3-litre twin-turbo straight-six as found in the M3, but the output has been dialled down slightly, so it’ll produce 460hp and 550Nm of torque. This power is delivered to the rear wheels only, and unlike the M3, you can pick the M2 up as either a manual or an automatic! 

The price starts from around £65,000, but is it really worth it? There’s only one way to find out - stick with Mat for this all-new review!

Supercars offer exhilarating performance and a gratifying driving experience, all wrapped up in stunningly beautiful aesthetics. They are also exorbitantly priced, which means that buying new is normally reserved for CEOs or lottery winners who can afford both the purchase price and the possible depreciation. Yet, if you shop around, you may find a multitude of cheaper supercars on the used market.
Hello everyone, and welcome to a brand new video on the channel. Today, we are going to talk about the 10 cheapest supercars you can afford.

Speed is an expensive habit, and the more you pay, the more you get. Take our long-term 2022 BMW M3. We could have spent more for the more powerful Competition trim or the quicker all-wheel-drive variant. Instead, we went with the $70,895 base model, which not only was less expensive but also allowed us to get a manual transmission. Our 2022 manual-transmission M3 delivered a lot of grins and very few gremlins over 40,000 miles.

This year’s crop of cars doesn’t look too different from that first event’s, when we ran a Corvette Z06 but not one with a mid-engine 670-hp V-8. A Cayman appeared on the first roster, although it was not nearly as track focused as this year’s Cayman GT4 RS.

There have been massive performance increases in the past 17 years, and not just for Porsches and Corvettes. The Honda Civic Type R offers 315 horsepower from the factory. Toyota fielded two cars: the rally-inspired GR Corolla and a manual-transmission-equipped Supra. Zero Hyundais appeared in 2006, but two this year—Kona N and Elantra N—returned times that might surprise you. BMW sent the M4 CSL and the electric i4 M50; both were significantly quicker than the 2006 M6 in the first event.

A new Subaru WRX and Audi RS3 brought a rally-car experience at two different price points. After a few issues with the BMW M240i, the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, and the Volkswagen GTI last year, we invited them back for a chance to improve their lap times. Mercedes and Lamborghini were missing from the first roster, but this year we lapped the new SL63, a 2+2 with all-wheel drive, and Lamborghini brought out a Huracán Tecnica, a less extreme version of the Huracán STO.

986,Eo_VcY-E14Y,Ferrari Purosangue DRIVEN: Worth £400k? | Top Gear,"So then, the Purosangue. In literal terms 'pureblood'. There's a V12 up front and all-wheel drive, but more importantly, four doors and four seats. Controversial. There's also a hatch and a decent enough boot, Ferrari even has plans for ski and bike carriers – carbon fibre and fabulously expensive, obviously – and the sense that if practicality had been skinned down to the bare essentials in favour of Ferrari-ness, you'd be looking at it. 

The 6.5-litre V12 produces 715bhp, enough to launch the Purosangue from 0-62mph in 3.3 seconds. Sprightly... But how does it fare on Italy's snow covered mountain roads? Top Gear Magazine's Associate Editor, Tom Ford, finds out.

987,bNkM-z3cPW8,2023 Corvette Z06 vs Ferrari 458 vs Porsche GT3 | Top Gear,"The ‘Z06’. If the Corvette is America’s Porsche 911, this is its GT3. And in American sports car folklore there is no bigger deal. But for Chevy’s latest it’s bucked the trend; no electric assistance, no hybrid help, and no turbos either. It’s got an entirely new engine, the LT6 - a 5.5-litre dry sump, flat-plane crank V8 taken from the C8R GTLM race car. Good for 670bhp and 459lb ft, it sees off 0–60mph in 2.7secs. It also sounds more Italian than American, like the great engine from a Ferrari 458. So we thought we’d bring one of those along. And Porsche’s GT3, because we’re thorough. But could this be America’s best sports car ever? Top Gear Magazine’s Ollie Marriage hit the road and track to find out.

997,PGKT7SbZcHU,Hot Tent Camping in CRAZY Blizzard (Rescuing Trapped Drivers & Almost Getting Trapped My Self),"I found the most beautiful winter camping spot ever to set up my hot tent teepee. But a massive snow storm dumped a large amount of snow and crazy winds about blew me off the mountain. Getting home turned out to be a bigger challenge than I anticipated and I ended up helping some stuck drivers along the way. Defiantly one of the more intense endings to a video I have ever done.

999,C8UxyMrBu4I,Man Leaves City to Create Beautiful Permaculture Farm,"14 years ago, Crispin Moorey quit his city job to start a beautiful permaculture farm and homestead in the Japanese countryside together with his wife Kazumi. Dissatisfied with their life in the city, they craved a deeper connection to nature. Their unique off-grid permaculture farm and homestead includes many self-built structures such as a yurt, a shed and a barn as well as a productive mandala garden. Crispin's permaculture farm is a great example of regenerative agriculture and shows that it is possible to carve out a living from taking good care of Mother Earth. Crispin and his wife add value to the crops they grow by turning them into delicious shelf-stable products first, processing and packaging everything in-house before selling them directly to their customers across Japan.

1031,Dqn7NQ228w0,Leaky Vintage Floor Jack Restoration (Hein Werner),"My dad has had this car jack for years. He bought it used and apparently the previous owner made some interesting modifications to it... They used to use these things to re-bend vehicle frames back into shape after an accident which put a lot of stress on them. Anyway it was leaking pretty bad and wouldn't lift up a car anymore so I decided I'd rebuild it for him and make a restoration video out of it. 

I started this restoration project a few years ago, but after I tore it apart I realized I'd need a lathe to actually fix it up properly. It sat in a storage bin for years in pieces  until I got a lathe and enough courage to try and put it all back together. Sorry the video ended up being a feature length film... I couldn't really cut it down much more and I don't like multi-part series.

What do the North Pole and our cabin have in common? We're both experiencing a polar vortex!! If you're not familiar with the term, it's basically extremely cold storm of ice and snow, normally only found at the North and South poles of our planet. But occasionally, the storm comes down south, and temperatures drop as low as -40! This can result in icy weather as far south as California, Texas and even Mexico. In the past we've escaped to warmer weather in our van, but this time we've decided to stay in the eye of the storm and embrace the weather in the woods! As you can imagine, braving a storm with limited supplies and power off the grid poses additional challenges. One of our main sources of heat is our wood stove, which makes things precarious when we run out of wood. So we raided our stash and got enough to hopefully last the storm. And speaking of logs, we finally got our Cinderella incinerator toilet working!! Yes, it literally burns our poop! And no, we won't be using that as a heat source. We made due with our wood stove, though it was still freezing. And while not having to go to the bathroom outside was a game changer, we gave a little peak behind the scenes on how frustrating it's been not being able to wash the dishes--something that's easy to take for granted. But despite these challenges, we were still able to find joy in the beauty of the storm, and reaffirmed that we can truly handle anything life throws our way, as long as we have each other! Do you have any tips on making it through the cold months? What keeps you going? Comment below!

Our Journey! How did we get here?
In the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands. Thank you for being here with us for cabin life, van life and all the in between!

1068,dVO-7rchstw,Silicon Valley Bank MELTDOWN Explained | How to PREPARE for the RECESSION | Jaspreet Singh,"Learn how to build IRONCLAD discipline in this free workshop:
https://bit.ly/3QGo7ln

On Today's Episode: 
Here’s how the second-biggest bank collapse in U.S. history happened in just 48 hours. Silicon Valley Bank closed its doors today. Within 48 hours, a panic induced by the very venture capital community that SVB had served and nurtured ended the bank’s 40-year-run.

Regulators shuttered SVB Friday and seized its deposits in the largest U.S. banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis and the second-largest ever. The company’s downward spiral began late Wednesday, when it surprised investors with news that it needed to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its balance sheet. What followed was the rapid collapse of a highly-respected bank that had grown alongside its technology clients.
You are not alone if the recession has you nervous about what to expect. People have real concerns about whether or not they’ll be able to afford groceries, gas, and even rent! 

For sure you’ve heard that millionaires are made in recessions, but how?

Jaspreet Singh is joining Tom for a second time to get you up to speed on what it takes to get wealthy during any recession. Jaspreet is the Minority Mindset guru and Chief Money Nerd at Minority Mindset Companies. He’s been creating financial education videos on YouTube for years and is breaking down all the reason you don’t have to be scared during a recession

Jaspreet is a voice of reason to remember that recessions are only bad or good in relation to which side of the equation you are on. This is a must watch if you’re trying to find the best route through a recession that has most people nervous and panicked.

1070,i3h37e4e3bQ,A Cookie in a Cookie in a Cookie in a Cookie in a Cookie…,"👇 *RECIPE BELOW* 👇
Really more of a cake, this bake-speriment attempts to answer the age-old question ""How many different cookies can you combine in a single cookie recipe?"". My lawyers tell me I can't recommend anyone actually make this recipe, but if you really want to give it a try (at your own risk, of course!) here's the recipe for each component, assembly instructions are in the video.

*Double Cookie Cookies*
Adapted from a recipe by Christina Tosi (Milkbar).

*Ingredients*
• 225 g (1 cup, 2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
• 300 g (1 ½ cups) granulated sugar 
• 100 g (⅓ cup) glucose
• 1 egg
• 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
• 60 g (⅓ cup) 55% chocolate, melted
• 200 g (1 ⅔ cup)  all-purpose flour
• 100 g (2 ¼ cups) cocoa powder
• ¾ tsp. baking powder 
• ½ tsp.  baking soda 
• 1 ¾ tsp. kosher salt
Approx. ½ cup of mini cookie cereal such as Cookie Crisp® or Chips Ahoy® 

*Directions*
1.  Combine the butter, sugar, and glucose in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Cream together on medium-high for 2-3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the spatula, add the egg, vanilla, and melted chocolate, and beat for 7-8 minutes until very light and fluffy.

2. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Using a 2 3⁄4 -ounce ice cream scoop (or a 1/3-cup measure), scoop double portions (i.e. two scoops per cookie) of the dough onto a parchment or silicone baking mat lined baking sheet. You don’t need to leave space between the cookies at this point, as they’ll be refrigerated before baking.

3. Pat the tops of the cookie dough domes a little bit flat with your hand, and place as many mini cereal cookies on top of each dough round as you like. Keep in mind the cookies will spread a fair bit while baking, so you may want to really crowd the cereal cookies on.

4. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week. If you bake your cookies from room temperature, they will spread more and bake flatter than intended.

5. Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190° C). Bake for 14–16  minutes, until spread and puffed. With how dark the cookies are it will be difficult to tell when they’re done based on colour alone. When they’ve lost their shine, they should be good to go. You may want to bake just one cookie first and let it cool completely to work out the best timing for your oven.
Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pans before transferring to a plate or an airtight container for storage. At room temperature, the cookies will keep fresh for 5 days; in the freezer, they will keep for 1 month.

*Oreo® Cookie Butter Pucks*
Makes enough for 4 giant cookie sandwiches.

*Ingredients*
• 4 Oreo cookies, any flavour you like. I used Double-Stuf® Oreos
• 1 - 14 oz jar of Speculoos Cookie Butter spread

*Directions*
1. Line 4 wells of a metal standard size muffin tin with paper liners, or use a silicone muffin tin (no need to line or butter the wells).

2. Microwave the cookie butter for 15–30 seconds at a time, or until melted enough to pour. It will likely take around 1 minute in total. Make sure to remove every last bit of the foil liner from the lid of the jar before microwaving.

3. Fill 4 wells of the muffin tin about a third to a half of the way up. Press an Oreo® cookie into each well.

4. Top with an equal amount of cookie butter, and spread as flat as you can. Freeze until completely solid, 1–2 hours. Leave in the freezer until cookies are ready to assemble.

*Edible Cookie Dough Frosting*
Makes enough for 4 giant cookie sandwiches.

*Ingredients*
• 454 g (4 sticks, 2 cups) unsalted butter, at room temperature (226 g)
• 215 g (1 cup) light brown sugar (108 g)
• 340 g (3 cups) powdered sugar (170 g)
• 1 tbsp. + 1 tsp. Vanilla extract (2 tsp)
• ½–¾ cup Milk or cream
• 80 g (⅔ cup) all-purpose flour (40 g)
• 1 tsp. Kosher salt 

*Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Spread the flour onto a baking tray. Bake in the oven for 10–15 minutes, and allow to cool completely. This kills any bacteria in the flour making it safe to eat in a raw cookie dough, so don’t skip this step!

2. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream the butter until smooth and very fluffy, about 3–5 minutes.

3. Scrape down the bowl.  Add the sugars and mix thoroughly.

4. Add the flour and mix until just combined. 

5. Add the salt and vanilla, and beat for about 1 minute more until fluffy again.

6. Add the milk or cream a little at a time until the consistency of frosting.

7. Cover the mixer bowl with plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to assemble the cookies (or leave at room temperature for up to 2 hours). If it has firmed up too much to pipe while in the fridge, you will need to take it out 20–30 minutes earlier and re-whip it to soften up before piping.",2023-03-05 19:19:39+00:00,705.4341854252777,13,Lowbrow Fancy,UC4U_Y_6rTnHUhMuYTGK2wdg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3h37e4e3bQ/default.jpg,120,90,234,hd,true,786,39,0,4,,2022-08-19 13:28:15+00:00,227.63713588783563,19640,33,140

1087,kG9MM_7Wtvg,What Happened to Julian Newman?,"What Happened to Julian Newman? 

This video is presented with educational purposes to detail the rise of Julian Newman from a childhood of being a basketball prodigy to his unfortunate downfall as an adult. Since Julian garnered the attention of millions around the world at such a young age, he has left many wondering, ""What exactly happened to Julian Newman?"" After doing my research and reading numerous articles, I've broken it down to three major reasons as to why his stardom peaked before adulthood. Even though he graduated high school without any college scholarship offers or professional basketball offers, I wish him nothing but the best. He is still young and if he dedicates himself to understanding the game of basketball, I believe Julian can still play at the next level of basketball. After all, as I mentioned in the video, he is a very skilled player who just lacks some key elements of basketball. If Julian learned how to master the parts of his game that aren't the strongest, Julian has a strong case for being able to play college ball or professional basketball somewhere. Thank you for watching, enjoy!

Lyrics
Ay ojalá que nunca se apague la luz 
que tienen tus ojos
que nunca te falte nada
porque tu te mereces todo
tú eres la culpable que yo existo en este mundo loco 
ay la única mujer que esta vida 
nunca me ha dejado solo

Como te pago, 
con lo que te mereces
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses
Ay dime como te pago 
con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses

Antes decía mami y ahora te digo mamá
ay gracias por enseñarme a hablar y a caminar
madrecita de mi vida 
no te me vayas jamás 
ay porque voy a llorar y voy a llorar 
si tu te me vas

Como te pago 
con lo que te mereces
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses
Ay dime Como te pago
 con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses

Hay quien tiene a su madre lejos y otros no la tienen
hay quien tiene a su madre en la casa pero no la quiere
como yo amo a la mía 
con este amor profundo 
porque para mi el amor de una madre es el más grande del mundo

Como te pago 
con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses
Ay dime Como te pago 
con lo que te mereces 
el tiempo que viví 
dentro de ti esos 9 meses

Y ojalá que dios me le dé mucha salud 
mucha bendición 
pa mi madre
Dicelo Mauro
Lenier 
Mambo

Letra: 
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente
Es como tapar una herida con maquillaje, no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía me está' viendo toa' la historia' (No; papi)

Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (-íto')
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errores no repito (Ey, papi)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte (Ah)
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen los reporte'
Ahora tú quieres volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al menos yo te tenía bonito (Shakira, Shakira)

Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más leve
Volver contigo never, tú eres la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía
Tú buscando por fuera la comida
Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida
Pero si ella supiera que me busca' todavía

Bebé, ¿qué fue? (Fue), ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (Ah)
¿Qué haces buscándome el la'o? (Ey) Si sabes que yo errores no repito
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombres no compito (Mueve el culito)
Que no tiene buena mano, y al menos yo te tenía bonito

O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Mi amor, es que usted se alejó mucho
Y yo de lejos ya no veo, bebé
TQM pero TQG, jajaja

Lyrics:
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

See it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever (lasts forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (last together)

🌻 READ BEFORE COMMENTING
Create a fun and lighthearted comment section. I’ll be happy to take constructive criticism if it means it’ll help me make better compilations in the future, but I will not tolerate straight up child-like behavior in my comment section. If hate is being sent to me or the creators in my compilations for absolutely no reason then I can easily delete those comments and block you because I don’t want to see it and I don’t want anyone else seeing it. If your only purpose is to spread hate, then please go somewhere else because no one asked for your opinion.

1127,qFLCyvoCQas,【サーキットレビュー】アストンマーティン ヴァルキリー,"UKチャンネル投稿日 2023/03/07

ついにマットがアストンマーティンのヴァルキリーを試乗する時が来ました！

彼は中東のバーレーン インターナショナル サーキットに飛び、公道走行可能なF1マシンを実際に走らせて、実際にハンドルを握ったときの狂気ぶりを確認します。

ヴァルキリーの魅力は何でしょうか？
まず、ヴァルキリーの空力担当であるエイドリアンは、4つの要素が重要であると言います。フロントウイングを担うボンネットや、後ろの巨大なリアディフューザーなど、さまざまな空力の工夫がなされているそうです。その結果、ヴァルキリーは、今までに見たことのないような外観に仕上がりました。

内装は収納こそ少ないものの、車載スクリーンやエアコンなど、クルマとしての機能は充実しています。

そしてもちろん、驚異的なパワーユニットも搭載しています。6.5Lの自然吸気V12エンジンと電気モーターを組み合わせたヴァルキリーは、最高出力1,001馬力、最大トルク924Nmを発生します。また、レブリミッターは11,000RPMにもなります！ 

問題は、ヴァルキリーが見た目と同様にサーキットで絶大な力を発揮できるかということです。マットは公道走行可能なF1マシンの脅威的ななパワーを扱えるのでしょうか? この動画を最後まで見て、それをあなたの目で確かめてみましょう！

IL NARCOFUTBOL

Oscar Cordoba, il portiere, è appena rimasto piantato nel terreno, con le ginocchia in avanti e il corpo totalmente all’indietro. Sembra un manichino rotto, buttato lì in un magazzino, pronto per essere smaltito. E se la storia non fosse questa, se fosse soltanto il racconto di una partita di calcio, si potrebbe dire che la sua postura ricorda quella di una persona a cui hanno appena sparato. Ma non è un’analogia che si può usare, perché questa storia finirà davvero con dei proiettili. Oscar Cordoba è stato preso alla sprovvista dalla deviazione inaspettata di Andres Escobar, uno dei difensori più forti e più eleganti che il calcio colombiano abbia mai visto. Il numero 2 della selezione cafetera ha messo il piede su un cross rasoterra, e la partita contro gli Stati Uniti è appena diventata un Everest, impossibile da scalare. Ma per arrivare all’epilogo dobbiamo partire da lontano e scoprire perché, nel 1994, pensare alla Colombia tra le favorite per la vittoria di un Mondiale non era un’eresia. E anche perché una squadra così quotata si è sbriciolata in questo modo, in due partite: la teorica fine gloriosa di una generazione d’oro che si trasforma in un dramma in mondovisione. Una volta rimessi insieme tutti i pezzi del puzzle, diventerà chiaro anche il motivo che porta un bambino, vedendo suo padre in televisione deviare un pallone che forse avrebbe dovuto lasciare sfilare, a confidare alla mamma la paura di vedere il suo eroe ucciso. Una profezia che si sarebbe tristemente, tragicamente, avverata.

«El narcotrafico toca todo, es un pulpo. El futbol es una isla? No». 
(Francisco Pacho Maturana)

Una sola qualificazione ai Mondiali dal 1938 al 1986. La storia calcistica della Colombia era stata a lungo marginale, con un solo acuto degno di nota: il secondo posto nella Copa America del 1975. Ci era arrivata sfruttando una formula particolare, che aveva spedito l’Uruguay campione in carica direttamente in semifinale e aveva diviso le altre nove squadre in tre gironi. Ma Argentina e Brasile erano finite insieme nel Gruppo A, con il Venezuela a fare da vittima sacrificale: 26 gol subiti in 4 partite. Il Brasile si era fatto strada vincendo i due scontri diretti e presentandosi così alla semifinale contro il Perù, guidato da un giocatore sublime come Teofilo Cubillas. La Colombia aveva approfittato di un girone morbido e aveva spazzato via l’Uruguay, costruendo la qualificazione nel match di andata a Bogotà e rendendo indolore la sconfitta di Montevideo. Sempre a Bogotà, nella finale di andata, Ponciano Castro aveva illuso il popolo colombiano, salvo dover poi fare i conti con il bruciante 2-0 subito a Lima. Il format della Coppa, a quel punto, prevedeva una gara di spareggio, da giocare in campo neutro, e non l’assegnazione della coppa al Perù alla luce del doppio confronto. A Caracas, il 28 ottobre del 1975, era stato Hugo Sotil, el Cholo, un genio che si era guadagnato la chiamata prestigiosa del Barcellona, a risolvere la contesa e a relegare la Colombia al secondo posto.

Deontay wilder sebelumnya adalah seorang petinju luar biasa yang tak terkalahkan dan memegang gelar dunia wbc kelas berat sebelum dia dikalahkan oleh seorang Tysn Fury. Dia kalh sebanyak dua kali oleh petiju yang sama yaitu tyson fury. Deontay wilder vs tyson fury dianggap sebagai pertarungan terbaik dikelas berat era saat ini karena menampilkan pertarungan yang sangat luar biasa dan digelar sebanyak 3 kali. sebuah pertarungan yang tidak mungkin tidak menarik karena digelar 3 kali. Fury vs wilder 4 kini digadang gadang untuk digelar lagi sebab wilder kesulitan mencari lawan dan hanya seorang tyson fury yang mempunyai cara untuk mengalahkannya. boxing news full fight tyson fury vs wilder.

I get to raise an animal that faced near extinction at one point, and is now a living history. In March 2018, we started raising our small herd of six bison. These are amazing animals. We are learning more and more about them. We want to continue to grow our herd through conservation and promotion of a healthy meat. We hope to educate and share our experiences with anyone who wants to follow us along on our journey of the great American Bison.

Who are Kara and Nate?! 
Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎

We started our YouTube channel on a whim when we decided to take a year off and go travel back in 2016. One year quickly turned into 4, and at the very end of 2019 we stepped foot in our 100th country. If you want a quick summary of that journey you can watch the documentary here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg

Shortly after achieving our 100 country goal, the pandemic hit. With international travel no longer an option, we bought a van and spent two years traveling around the U.S. living in our tiny home on wheels.

At the beginning of 2022, we moved out of the van and back into our suitcases full-time. We're not exactly sure what our next ""goal"" is going to be, but we're currently having fun bouncing around the globe chasing our passions and interesting stories.

1156,Q_BYtobvwl8,First Class on a Ritz Carlton Luxury Cruise | Evrima,"Check out Carl Friedrik's “The Luggage Set” here: https://friedrik.com/0m2

Today I’m taking one of the world’s most luxurious cruises for 5 days across the Caribbean. This is the long awaited Ritz Carlton Yacht, Evrima. Scheduled to launch in 2020, this was pushed back around 8 times until finally last October she was launched. I’ve experienced a few luxury cruises now, but this was different. With far fewer passengers, the level of staffing should be an unparalleled experience onboard.

I'll show you the entire experience from boarding in Florida, touring my suite along with the most luxurious ""Owners Suite"" onboard. We'll check out the dining, explore the marina and fully emerce ourselves in the world of Ritz Carlton. 

Unfortunately today’s ultra luxury cruise wasn’t quite as seamless as I’d hoped. In this video I’ll be breaking down exactly what happened and if I think you should try it for yourself. As always, I remain unbiased and honest in my reviews, this is no exception.

1161,kyS4Bhac0BM,President Biden HATED My Theme Park!,"President Joe Biden is visiting my theme park, Spy Ninjas HQ. The President of the United States is in Las Vegas for a variety of reasons including the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition. He would like to take a tour of our family entertainment center and if he gives it the Presidential Seal of Approval, he'll make sure a Spy Ninjas HQ is opened in every state, so everyone across America can get into a healthier lifestyle.

On the way to Spy Ninjas HQ, the President ran into some bad weather and is now delayed. We must start the tour via Facetime. Daniel walks POTUS through all the fun activities such as the trampoline park, ninja tag warrior course, climbing walls, zip line, ropes course, arcade, axe throwing, and more. Mr. Biden seems really concerned about the socks though. He makes Daniel take his shoes off and show his feet. The President is increasingly making the call awkward and uncomfortable. We're not sure if he's going to approve the opening of more locations.

1191,iwtSHXJUOFg,TAVARISH purchased the £2Million FLOODED McLaren P1,"#mclarenp1 #tavarish #flooded #supercars #p1flood #rebuild 

What is up everyone and welcome back to a brand new video! 2 Months ago I flew out to Florida with Petrolheadonism and Hardupgarage to check out @tavarish workshop and to film with Matt Armstrong who is also out there rebuilding a Porsche 992 GT3 in his garage, however Tavarish went a bit crazier than rebuilding just a GT3...

Back to last year and in September a massive hurricane hit Florida which caused huge floods with most cars around the area being damaged and swept away, and unfortunately that included this one week old newly brought McLaren P1 which costed around £2Million! but sadly this one literally got swept away, completely going under water and ending up 500metres down the road all damaged and likely to be heading to the scrap yard the next week...

That's until Tavarish has crazily brought the ""flooded"" P1 and which I think most people can say it will be by far the wildest automotive rebuilds, or at least supercars on YouTube.

Big thank you to Freddy for letting us come to his workshop and showing us around his P1 so we could make videos which you guys are seeing here, please go and show support on his channel and watch the first episode to this build here:

Like Lomedy and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft SMP. Like Parrot / ParrotX2 Lifesteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 12.240 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. I escaped this Minecraft prison like Omziiscool but not Parrot or Clownpierce or Spoke with 100+ / 2,193 Bedrock and TNT.  This stacked player stole my permanent hearts on the Lifesteal SMP. Like any other video mine such as I Started Minecraft's Greatest Business, or I Trained a Minecraft Frog to Kill People, are unscripted videos of mines! in this video I will be trying to upgrade Minecraft's Oldest Traps/ Old Traps such as Tree Traps, Door Traps, and Chest traps, ALL 3 BEING 8 YEARS OLD IN MINECRAFT/Xbox 360 Minecraft trolling but I'm also breaking this corrupted sever/ corrupted admin, dupping, breaking this PW2 (pay 2 wins) Minecraft server

Erling Haaland and Phil Foden both scored hat-tricks, with City running out 6-3 winners in front of a packed Etihad crowd. 

The champions were 4-0 ahead at half-time after two goals apiece from Foden and Haaland, as United struggled to cope with the speed of of our football.

1229,aLGNlGCPlFw,When Subaru Put a “Jet Engine” In Their Exhaust | Rocket Anti-Lag Explained!,"Anti-lag systems help a turbocharger to continue producing boost when a driver is out of the throttle, but did you know that the Subaru rally team had one that could fully spool a turbo at idle? The Subaru Impreza WRX STi S11 and S12 WRC generations featured a unique system dubbed Rocket Anti-Lag. Using patented technology from Prodrive and similar principles to a jet engine combustor, the cars were fitted with a separate combustion chamber in the exhaust.

The system that drivers like Petter Solberg and Mads Ostberg got to enjoy has puzzled people for some time, so I decided to read through the patent documentation and try to understand how it works. So let’s learn how anti-lag works, then go over all of the awesome engineering behind the rocket system! This is Subaru’s Rocket Anti-Lag explained!

1233,AMj5bIRqiLE,DEVASTATED Audi S6 5.2L V10 Engine Teardown. YOU CAN'T POWER THROUGH THAT! But Yet Here We Are.,"Please visit www.Importapart.com and peruse our inventory including our complete parts cars! If you don't see what you're looking for, fill out our part request form or email us at Importapartsales@gmail.com    
This is a teardown for the books! Some of you have seen this engine floating around in the background of previous teardown videos. I've been avoiding this one for a month or two, and have burned through all of my ""easy"" engines. Decided to rip the scab off, and get to this 5.2L BXA Audi V10 core that came in. I knew nothing about it. It was cheap, not a high risk engine. This was filmed over 3 different occasions, and required a lot of on the fly research to get it apart remotely correctly. I'm hardly an Audi or VW guy, and this is the first engine of this type I've ever torn down. 
The 5.2L BXA came in the Audi C6 S6 starting in 2007. They are rated 435hp and 398lbft of torque. Personally, they seem incredibly complex for the power they make however they do sound pretty amazing. This particular engine was pretty pooched. Whoever was behind the wheel when this happen tried to power through whatever the situation was, and it wasn't the right call and it likely cost them their car as it was junked after this. 

I really hope you enjoyed this teardown, it was a lot of fun to learn how it came apart both the right way and the wrong way. 
As always, I appreciate all of the comments, feedback and even the criticism. Catch you all on the next one!

WOW is all I can say. I have always wanted to get one of these engines on the channel but I NEVER imagined I would find one blown up in such spectacular fashion. This engine has been previously rebuilt but its days as anything other than scrap, are over. 
The 8L Magnum V10 was based on the 5.9L 360ci V8, which is based on the old LA small block Chrysler V8. Coming out for the 1994 model year, the 8.0L V10 made a LOT more power and torque than its Chevrolet and Ford big block competitors. 310hp and 450lb ft of torque made these things a monster in the 90's. This engine is NOT based on the Dodge Viper V10. Dodge continued production of these engines until the 2003 model year. 
Why am I doing this? I own and run a full service auto salvage business in the Saint Louis Missouri area, and part of our model includes buying cores and dismantling them to salvage the reusable parts for resale. We do not rebuild engines, merely supply parts to those that do. 

I really hope you enjoyed this teardown, it has been one of my favorites so far. As always I appreciate all of the comments, feedback and even the criticism.

The Chevrolet Corvette Ls3 is one of the most popular motors of all time.  With a massive amount of motor swap vehicles built around the Corvette Ls3 platform.  It is easy to see why the Corvette Ls3 is such a popular choice once you work around them.

The Porsche 911 is one of the most famous and storied vehicles ever built.  The Porsche 911 comes in several variations including the very capable Porsche  911 Turbo models.  The Porsche 911s horizontally opposed 6 cylinder engine mounted in the rear is one of the most unique designs to come from the factory.

So, it only seems like a match made in heaven to combine the power and simplicity of the Corvette Ls3, and the timeless design of the Porsche 911.  When motor swapping a vehicle, nothing ever goes to plan.  Especially when working on a Porsche 911.  So, lets see how well this Corvette Ls3 v8 fits into the back of a Porsche 911 that was never designed for it!

New compressor had to be quieter, build air pressure much faster and to have a much drier air output. I had to Hydro test the tank along the way as well as building a water aftercooler to drastically lower the charge air temperature. Final result is a much a better compressor that builds crazy fast air pressure, puts out bone dry air and way quieter.

In televisione è stata una delle puntate più viste, a dimostrazione che gli italiani amano ancora la 127 come il primo giorno. Al di là dell'affetto per una macchina intramontabile, in questa puntata vedremo la seconda parte della trasformazione operata da Polini Motorsport e la prova finale, stavolta non in pista, ma su una strada di montagna chiusa al traffico, proprio sul percorso di una Prova Speciale rally.

La formula è semplice già dai primi video: non si chiacchiera troppo, non si ricorre a musichette improbabili e si lascia parlare le automobili. Il Drive Experience di Davide Cironi vuole ricordare quello che chi sapeva ha dimenticato e vuole far conoscere a chi non c'era quello che si è perso. Questo non vuol dire che si parli solo di passato, ma anzi, il programma si cura in egual modo anche del presente e del futuro. Si attinge dai grandi Vecchi e dalle loro storie perché possiamo noi prenderne spunto e continuare a far vivere il nostro amore per l'automobile sportiva. Infine ci sono loro, le macchine, con le infinite sfumature e anime, che Davide prova a farci assaporare dal sedile del passeggero. www.driveexperience.it",2013-06-04 10:32:38+00:00,3590.7590919063546,138210893,325,506000

The Lexus RZ 450e has a surprising amount in common with the Tesla Model S. They're both electric, they're both all-wheel-drive, and they both offer a steering yoke! Not surprising, Lexus doesn't want to call it a yoke, because Tesla's steering yoke got so much negative feedback upon it's release, and with good reason. Lexus has overcome the Tesla's flaws, however, with a clever new design: steer-by-wire. You see, there isn't anything physically connecting the steering wheel to the steering rack; all communication is electronic! 

Before you freak out, know that we'll deep dive into this technology in this video, answering the following five questions:
1) How does steer-by-wire work?
2) Why would you use steer-by-wire, and what are the advantages?
3) Can you trust steer-by-wire to be safe and reliable?
4) Why is Tesla's steering yoke a bad design?
5) What drawback's does Lexus steer-by-wire system have?

Enjoy the video!

I bought a used truck and the previous owner tried to hide a bent rim with a cheap thin layer of plastidip. Maybe 2 cans on all 4 wheels. I've struggled removing even good plastidip before and I stumbled upon a youtube video of a guy suggesting Kerosene. Wanted to try it out myself and also give others a second-hand review to prove whether or not it worked. I could not recommend this method more! Don't even waste your time doing anything else but this. I bought the Kerosene at my local Walmart for $8 a gallon. Only used 1 gallon for all 4 wheels and i really slapped it on there.

1252,gVudIIhyjt8,EVERTON 1-1 TOTTENHAM | Premier League highlights,"Another spirited display didn’t look to be enough when Abdoulaye Doucoue was shown a straight red card just before the hour mark for a shove on Harry Kane, before the England striker netted from the penalty spot minutes later after Keane has brought down Cristian Romero.

But Everton refused to give in. And after piling on the pressure despite the numerical disadvantage, a straight red card for substitute Lucas Moura for a late challenge on Keane two minutes from time offered a lifeline.

Keane then turned hero in dramatic fashion, smashing a superb 25-yard drive past Hugo Lloris to spark jubilant scenes around Goodison.

Sit back and enjoy as Carlo Ancelotti and his men defeated Real Valladolid courtesy of a top notch first half in which they scored four goals. The first was an early Rodrygo Goes goal after a pin-point Asensio assist, and then it was time for the Karim Benzema show. The Frenchman scored three goals in seven minutes, completing his hat trick with a brilliant bicycle kick. Marco Asensio crowned a top performance with a goal of his own in the second half and Lucas Vazquez made it six with a goal in extra time.

1270,1HIhb7A0xX4,The Equalizer | Robert Fights a Russian Gang (Denzel Washington),"Robert (Denzel Washington) walks in on an underground sex-trafficking operation and after his initial offer to shut down the operation is rejected, takes matters into his own hands.

Watch the full movie now! https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/The_Equalizer?id=vTQIRJzKdJo

McCall (Denzel Washington) has put his mysterious past behind him and is dedicated to living a new, quiet life. But when he meets Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can’t stand idly by. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer.
